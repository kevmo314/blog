    <h1>The Road to Zero Disconnects: The Muxbox</h1>
    <em>April 14th, 2021</em>
    <p>
      IRL streaming is difficult. Maintaining a connection fast enough to stream
      video in variable environments causes many issues. In this post, I cover
      the ~3 months of work I've done so far to build a stable IRL streaming rig
      that outperforms many existing solutions. This post is also intended to be
      a technical document detailing all the research I've done so it will be
      quite opaque. A more accessible version (probably a YouTube video) is
      coming soon, but until then please only contact me for support if you have
      gone through the guide and understand what's going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note for new streamers:</strong> You probably don't need this
      guide. This note is really important and I've put it right at the top
      intentionally. You don't need to have zero disconnects. Get your phone,
      boot up Streamlabs, and start streaming. Or grab your GoPro and use the
      app to stream. Your first priority is <em>streaming</em>, not finding a
      perfect rig.
    </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      This document assumes some familiarity with how IRL streaming works today.
      Current IRL streaming solutions boil down to the following options, in
      what I believe descending order of market share.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="https://streamlabs.com/mobile-app">Streamlabs's mobile app</a>
        or GoPro's app

        + Encoder
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://belabox.net">BELABOX</a> + Encoder</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      There are some other options with alternative cameras, but I will focus on
      the above five as they work with the current most popular camera set:
      either the GoPro, the Sony AS300, or a high quality phone camera. The
      primary issues I find with these solutions are
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>High cost.</strong> Options 2-4 are considered professional
        options and above generally exceed $1.5k USD in cost.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Many components and fragility.</strong> Options 2-5 all require
        multiple parts and cables to wire everything together. Streamers
        typically assemble backpacks just to carry all this around, but having
        many parts results in more parts that can break, leading to higher
        fragility. This manifests in many streamers needing to carry backup HDMI
        cables. Interestingly, this is probably the main reason option 1 does so
        well in practice: it only requires a phone.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Overheating.</strong> Options 2-5 all utilize an external
        encoder. The GoPro has a perfectly good encoder (and actually quite
        efficient), despite being
        <a
          href="https://community.gopro.com/t5/GoPro-Labs/RTMP-disconnects-with-quot-Network-Error-quot/td-p/1047995"
          >wrapped in some bad software</a
        >. Having an encoder draws a lot of power, which is converted to heat.
        Many streamers often complain about overheating issues as the encoder is
        often located in their backpack.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Heavy weight.</strong> Powering an external encoder draws a lot
        of power. It is not unusual to see streamers using multiple
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/MAXOAK-50000mAh-Portable-Charger-External/dp/B00YP823NA"
          >MAXOAK battery banks</a
        >
        to power their backpack, resulting in 10+ lb backpacks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No modifiability.</strong> Options 1-4 all rely on proprietary
        components. The stability of the system is at the will of proprietary
        code and can't easily be modified. And I'm a software engineer so I like
        writing my own code.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A mininal backpack setup looks like the following</p>
    <img src="images/the-road-to-zero-disconnects-1.jpg" />
    <p>Perhaps not huge, but we can do better.</p>
    <h2>The Muxbox: Overview</h2>
    <p>Let's break down what we need in an IRL streaming rig.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Camera.</strong> There are basically three options: your phone,
        a GoPro, or a Sony AS300. Most streamers seem to use a phone due to ease
        of use or the Sony AS300 due to GoPro's terrible software. But the GoPro
        has a big benefit over the other two that I personally care a lot about:
        exceptional stabilization. Being a bike streamer, the shakiness of the
        Sony AS300 is difficult to watch and even the stabilization of the Pixel
        5 is not great. Of course, this depends on use case.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Encoder.</strong> This converts the camera video feed into a
        H.264/265 stream to be sent over the network.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cell bonder.</strong> One way to improve stability is to bond
        multiple cell connections together. When one connection goes down,
        another can take over if it's available. Alternatively, if two
        connections are operating at 3 Mbps, we can bond them together to
        achieve 6 Mbps.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In the Muxbox, I use a GoPro, which supports RTMP streaming. Notably,
      however, it's not very good. When the GoPro runs into any sort of network
      problem it disconnects the stream. This is particularly annoying, but when
      I ran off of this setup, I measured disconnects between 1-2 per hour,
      depending on where I was located. This is actually surprisingly good,
      which is why I advocate that new streamers use this setup and not worry
      about a backpack. It's quite hard to do better than 1-2 disconnects per
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      To stabilize the network connection, I stream the Muxbox to a wifi access
      point broadcasted by a Jetson Nano. This Jetson Nano ingests the stream
      immediately, so the GoPro never sees any further downstream network
      problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Jetson Nano, I transmux the RTMP stream from the GoPro to an SRT
      stream. SRT provides more reliability than RTMP. However, in practice I've
      found that RTMP is not actually that much worse, but SRT recovers a bit
      faster from poor network connections. My understanding is that the LiveU
      actually uses RTMP successfully, which corroborates that RTMP is not
      actually as bad as many IRL streamers believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jetson Nano runs some custom bonding code and I use three Motorola
      Moto E's as modems, one per network (T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T). The SRT
      stream is sent through these bonded connections and received on a remote
      server, which reassembles the stream and pipes it to OBS. OBS adds the
      overlays and then sends the completed stream to Twitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's what the Muxbox looks like when all set up in a messenger bag.
      Plenty of room for activities!
    </p>
    <img src="images/the-road-to-zero-disconnects-2.jpg" />
    <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
    <p>
      The biggest benefit to this setup is fewer components. The Jetson Nano is
      reasonably small, but more significantly I do not require a fragile HDMI
      cable. Each component is individually powered (even the modems). The only
      single point of failure in my setup is the power to the Jetson Nano. In
      fact, having the GoPro wirelessly transmit to the Jetson Nano leads to
      unique streaming opportunities, such as being able to throw the GoPro or
      passing it between streamers, as well as allowing multiple cameras
      trivially.
      <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/moosedoesstuff">MooseDoesStuff</a> is a
      streamer that exemplifies these benefits, as he's not able to be tethered
      to his computer or carry a large backpack while working. An unintentional
      benefit of wireless streaming is also that the setup is quite water
      resistant. I'm generally not concerned at all streaming in the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, I leverage the GoPro's encoder, so a separate encoder isn't
      necessary. Since the encoder is often expensive and placed in the
      backpack, this ends up being a decent cost savings and dramatically
      reduces the amount of heat generated. The GoPro is typically in open air,
      so it's much easier to bleed off heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, the setup uses very little battery. I've found that the GoPro's
      encoder is notoriously efficient. I haven't run a full test, but a single
      20000 mAh battery should be enough to power a 12 hour stream. The longest
      stream I've run is about six hours with half the battery used. A MAXOAK
      battery would be equivalent to streaming for a full 36 hours. This also
      translates to weight savings. The Muxbox typically weighs 2-3 lbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, I use mostly easy-to-find parts. Even finding a Sony AS300 is
      getting difficult these days, let alone trying to actually acquire a LiveU
      Solo. The Jetson Nano is probably the hardest component to find, but other
      boards can also work.
    </p>
    <p>
      These benefits are not without some cons, however. The biggest con is a
      fixed bitrate. The GoPro streams at ~4500 kbps, which is much lower than
      what the LiveU outputs. I've chosen to accept this because I believe that
      value can both be configured with some firmware hacking and that GoPro
      will one day change the cap. However, subjectively it seems that most
      viewers still deem ~4500 kbps sufficiently high quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, the community around IRL streaming seems to have discounted
      wireless streaming and the GoPro entirely. I hope to change the
      perception, but currently there is not much community support around such
      efforts.
    </p>
    <h3>Components</h3>
    <p>
      So this is the good stuff. Here's the full hardware bill of materials. In
      total, it comes to ~$820 for a setup with three modems.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        (~$350) One GoPro. HERO 8/9 works best due to the
        <a href="https://gopro.github.io/labs/control/rtmp/">QR Code support</a
        >, but any version supporting RTMP streaming should work.
      </li>
      <li>
        (~$100) One
        <a
          href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit"
          >Jetson Nano</a
        >. Curiously, this is the only board that I have managed to get the
        GoPro to stabily connect to. I've tried the Latte Panda, Raspberry Pi,
        Rock Pi, and NanoPi, however none have been able to maintain a stable
        wifi connection with the GoPro except this one. The software doesn't
        require this specific board, however, so if you try other boards and
        manage to get it working, I'd love to hear. The form factor of the
        Jetson Nano is a bit annoying.
      </li>
      <li>
        (~$20) One
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Type-C-USB-C-charge-trigger-detector/dp/B07T2858G6"
          >power delivery decoy trigger</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/SIM-NAT-Pigtails-Security-Surveillance/dp/B01GPL8MVG/"
          >cables</a
        >. The Jetson Nano requires DC for higher power consumption. I've tried
        with the micro USB port, however it seems that it doesn't power the
        Jetson Nano sufficiently. I need to do more research in this area,
        because it should. Using a power delivery allows the board to be powered
        by USB-C, dramatically broadening the number of battery packs that are
        compatible. It would also work to buy a DC battery pack.
      </li>
      <li>
        (~$30) One
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Makeronics-Wireless-Bluetooth-Assembly-Instruction/dp/B07X2NLL85/"
          >Intel AC8265</a
        >
        wireless card and antenna set. Another annoyance with the Jetson Nano is
        it doesn't include wifi. C'est la vie.
      </li>
      <li>
        (~$100 each)
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Unlocked-Motorola-Camera-XT2052-1/dp/B086H3HH5V"
          >Motorola Moto E</a
        >'s, one per SIM card you want. Don't buy it off Amazon though, get them
        used. I bought a pack of three used for ~$250. Specifically this phone,
        however, because it has the best band coverage across all providers at a
        cheaper price point. If you're willing to spend more, the Pixel 4a 5G is
        a good bet too for a phone with very good band coverage but 5G support.
      </li>
      <li>
        (~$20) Any battery pack. I use
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Technology-High-Capacity-Compatible/dp/B07S829LBX/"
          >this one</a
        >, but it doesn't matter as long as you get one that supports Power
        Delivery.
      </li>
      <li>
        A remote Linux server. Actually I guess it doesn't have to be Linux. It
        needs to run Docker though.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Maybe get a Jetson Nano case too. There are a bunch off Amazon. I use
      <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/GeeekPi-Jetson-Cooling-Control-Developer/dp/B07VVJNXMB/"
        >this one</a
      >, but they all suck. Another reason I don't like the Jetson Nano.
    </p>
    <h3>Assembly</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Install the Intel AC8265 into the Jetson Nano and attach the antennas.
        Use
        <a
          href="https://desertbot.io/blog/how-to-add-a-dual-wifi-bluetooth-card-to-a-jetson-nano-intel-8265"
          >this guide</a
        >
        if you opted to buy a version with no instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Build your hacky power delivery cable to go from USB-C to DC barrel
        jack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optional: Follow
        <a
          href="https://blog.kevmo314.com/compiling-custom-kernel-modules-on-the-jetson-nano.html"
          >this guide</a
        >
        to compile a custom kernel module to enable TTL mangling. This gets
        around some providers' hotspot throttling. This can also be set in
        <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> however it didn't seem to work for me.
      </li>
      <li>
        Configure your Android phones to always tether. Under Developer Options,
        change Default USB configuration to USB tethering. Maybe turn on Do not
        Disturb permanently. I also change the background color to the
        providers' colors so I know which SIM is in which phone at a glance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optional: Install the
        <a
          href="https://community.gopro.com/t5/en/Introducing-GoPro-Labs/ta-p/603173"
          >GoPro labs firmware</a
        >
        so you can get QR code support. It makes starting the stream a lot
        easier.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boot up the Jetson Nano and install
        <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the Jetson Nano, run

        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the Jetson Nano, run

        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set up a wifi access point on the Jetson Nano.
        <ol>
          <li>Click the wifi networks icon in the menu bar</li>
          <li>Click <code>Edit Connections...</code></li>
          <li>Add a new connection</li>
          <li>Set it to <code>AP/Hotspot</code> mode</li>
          <li>Set your SSID and password</li>
          <li>Restart your Jetson Nano</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>On your VPS, install Docker.</li>
      <li>
        On your VPS, run
        <code
          >sudo docker run --detach --restart always --port 1985:1985/udp
          --add-host host.docker-internal:host-gateway

          muxfd/srt-relay</code
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        That's it! Try connecting your GoPro to the Jetson Nano's AP and stream
        to <code>rtmp://10.42.0.1:1935/live/mooo</code>. In OBS, you should be
        able to receive this as
        <code>srt://&lt;your server ip&gt;:1935?streamid=play/mooo</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Development History</h2>
    <p>
      In the process of developing the above setup, I've gone through a number
      of iterations. I use the metric of disconnects/hr which represents the
      number of times I need to stop and touch/reset the setup while streaming
      under typical conditions. A packet loss of greater than two seconds is
      also considered a disconnect, even if it's able to autorecover.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, I started with RTMP streaming through a single-SIM hotspot. This
      results in ~1-2 disconnects/hr. Again, remarkably difficult to do better
      than, so I recommend all streamers start with this setup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, I attempted to use a Raspberry Pi loaded with
      <a href="https://www.openmptcprouter.com/">OpenMPTCPRouter</a>. The issue
      with this approach is that OpenMPTCPRouter is not aware that the payload
      is video, so it does not actively discard packets when they are too late.
      This results in flooding the available bandwidth when bandwidth is
      recovered, extending downtime. This could potentially be worked around by
      cleverly setting the TTL on packets, however this would expose the GoPro
      to downstream network fluctuations as well. This setup results in ~6
      disconnects/hr.
    </p>
    <p>
      To attempt to proxy the connection so the GoPro doesn't see the network
      fluctuations, I attempted to use a Raspberry Pi to run nginx with a USB
      modem, the ZTE MF833V. This results in ~4 disconnects/hr.
    </p>
    <p>
      To improve reliability, I had the GoPro transmux the stream to SRT before
      sending it over the network. This results in ~3.5 disconnects/hr.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then learned that the GoPro doesn't really like the Raspberry Pi's wifi
      adapter. I tried various boards until landing on the Jetson Nano + Intel
      AC8265 with a single USB modem. This results in ~2 disconnects/hr.
    </p>
    <p>
      To bond multiple modems together, I then used
      <a href="https://github.com/BELABOX/srtla">srtla</a> for aggregation. This
      results in ~1.5 disconnects/hr.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hypothesized that the USB modems were not strong enough to maintain
      connection with the cell towers, so I switched to using a single Moto E.
      This results in ~1 disconnect/hr. With srtla and multiple modems, I am not
      able to see an improvement. I hypothesize that this is due to srtla
      relying on congestion control, whereas in my case it's better to push
      packets aggresively, as the bitrate cannot be adjusted upstream.

      In order to improve further, I wrote my custom bonding code to bond the
      modems together more aggressively to accommodate constant bitrates. This
      achieves an estimated ~0.3 disconnects/hr, which is the current state.
    </p>
    <h2>Further Research</h2>
    <p>
      As you can see, the road to zero disconnects/hr is a long one. I had
      anticipated I'd accomplish this in a month, however three months later,
      I'm still working on improving. Turns out, actually getting to zero is
      substantially more difficult than I thought, and getting to an acceptable
      rate of disconnects is much easier than I thought.

    <p>
      I'm proud to say though, based on watching other streamers' LiveU setups,
      they achieve ~0.75 disconnects/hr so this setup is capable of being more
      stable than a LiveU with equivalent bonded connections. I'm continuing to
      improve the stability of the bonding code and hope to further lower the
      disconnect rate.

      Furthermore, I'm currently investigating how to get rid of the Jetson
      Nano. Its form factor is rather annoying due to being totally overkill for
      what I'm asking it to do and the power delivery trigger can be a bit
      fragile. However, many other boards can't seem to maintain the wifi
      connection to the GoPro. I'm not sure why the Intel AC8265 specifically
      can maintain that connection. Even more peculiarly, I've run the Intel
      AC8265 in a Latte Panda with no success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I would also like to find a smaller form factor modem. The
      Motorola Moto E's have been great because they are slim, but they are
      comparably heavier than ZTE MF833V's which I've used as well due to
      carrying around a cell phone battery. However, I have not found a lighter
      modem that can maintain connection as well as a cell phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, more long term, I'd like to package the hardware and software into
      a much smaller form factor. There's no reason the entire setup needs to be
      larger than the size of a cell phone. I envision a product that allows
      people to buy a single device to stream off of, including multiple modems
      and a built in transmuxer. This could help reduce costs and further
      improve waterproofing.

    <h2>Acknowledgments and Retrospective</h2>
    <p>
      Thanks to everyone who has tuned into my streams. I basically use them as
      a testing ground and all my viewers are indirectly guinea pigs subjected
      to frequent F's and LSD. I guess my content is interesting enough that
      it's worth sitting through, but thanks everyone for helping me get this
      far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I want to thank rational_sail specifically with his
      <a href="https://github.com/BELABOX/srtla">BELABOX project</a> of which I
      used srtla as a basis for my own bonding code. He's done a great deal of
      work and BELABOX is a good alternative if you're looking for a solution
      that more closely mirrors the LiveU. If you're interested in a complete,
      no tech solution, ours can be found at <a href="https://shoppp.muxable.com">Muxable</a>.
      Your orders contribute to my research and development around IRL technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, one of my viewers, gregwire, has been particularly helpful in
      telling me about modem tech and antennas, which I formed a few more
      hypotheses around why the GoPro might be disconnecting and why my modems
      weren't strong enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back, it's clear my lack of hardware knowledge was the biggest
      impediment. I likely could have iterated much quicker investing in more
      expensive modem tech first and attempting to lower costs afterwards. I
      ended up losing a good amount of time to trying out cheaper boards that
      didn't make much progress whereas I should have started with a more
      expensive platform of stronger modems first. I got very lucky in trying
      the Jetson Nano not too late and I should've done that with my modems as
      well. Additionally, I continue to have a lack of insight into why the
      GoPro doesn't seem to like other boards, but unfortunately lack the
      knowledge to debug this further. This remains an open point that I'm not
      sure I'll be able to resolve.

      If you're interested in helping with development and experimentation, I'd
      love to hear from you.
