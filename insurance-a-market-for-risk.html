      Let's play a game. Send exactly 0.1 ETH (~$37 today) to the following
      address and if the transaction id ends with an odd digit (50% chance),
      I'll send 0.2 ETH back.
    </p>

    <p>This is a manual process, but I will send winners 0.2 ETH within 24h.</p>
    <p>
      Most people won't play even though the expected value of playing is zero
      (minus transaction fees). Because humans are naturally
      <strong>loss averse</strong>: we tend to prefer avoiding losses to
      equivalent gains. If you don't want to play because you don't trust me,
      funnily enough, this is also characterized by loss aversion. When we incur
      losses,

      worse than the equivalent gains and insurance companies work by trading on
      that difference.
    </p>
    <h2>Modeling loss aversion</h2>
    <p>
      To model the preference to avoid losses, our utility curve, the intrinsic
      value of a specific loss/gain, follows
    </p>
    <img src="/images/insurance-a-market-for-risk-1.png" />
    <p>
      Specifically, we value <span style="color: red">losses</span> much more
      negatively than the equivalent <span style="color: green">gain</span>.
      This asymmetry is known as <strong>loss aversion.</strong> Someone who is
      not loss averse has a utility curve that is symmetric with a red and green
      line approximately the same size.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/insurance-a-market-for-risk-2.png" />
    <h2>Insurance as a mitigation strategy</h2>
    <p>
      Despite loss aversion being tied to core human behavior, most economists
      do not consider it to be rational.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under rational behavior $1 is worth $1 and $100 is worth $100. Saving $100
      is functionally equivalent to making $100. Corporations operate under this
      strategy, observing that cost savings are equivalent to gained profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between a rational actor and a human behavior suggests that
      there is a market opportunity available. Consider a game with the
      following two choices.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Lose $550 with 100% certainty.</li>
      <li>Lose $1000 with 50% certainty or $0 with 50% certainty.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For the same loss aversion reason, many players will choose option 1: the
      idea of losing $1000 is harder to stomach than just incurring a $550 loss.
      Perfectly rational actors, however, will choose option 2 because its
      expected loss is $500.
    </p>
    <p>This $50 difference is known as the <strong>risk premium.</strong></p>
    <p>
      Taking calculated risks can look scary because the apparent expected
      payoff appears far more negative than the true expected payoff. Think
      about the prospect of quitting your job, asking your crush out, or going
      skydiving. In all of these cases, odds are that everything will work out,
      but the perceived fear can be high.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in all these cases, we don't have the luxury of choosing the outcome
      and reality doesn't always go according to plan.
    </p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      So, reality might stick us with choice 2: a 50% chance of $1000 loss and a
      50% chance of $0 loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, an insurance company comes and observes that the true expected value
      is different from the perceived expected value and that it can collect
      this risk premium by selling an <em>insurance product</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By aggregating over all consumers, as long as the insurance company is
      able to estimate the true expected value, it can sell a lower-risk,
      guaranteed-loss product at above the perceived expected value and profit
      from the risk premium. So that's where insurance comes from: it insures me
      against unrecoverable loss by removing uncertainty.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/insurance-a-market-for-risk-4.png" />
    <p>
      Consumers are willing to buy this product because they still stand to gain
      between the perceived expected value and the insurance premium.
      Specifically, the space between the
      <span style="color: blue">insurance premium</span> and the
      <span style="color: grey">true expected value</span> is the insurance
      company's profit and the space between the
      <span style="color: red">perceived expected value</span> and the
      <span style="color: blue">insurance premium</span> is the consumer's
      profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The insurance companies are effectively
      <strong>trading risk as an product.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Alternative mitigation strategies</h2>
    <p>
      Interestingly, not every loss-aversion-affected game can be traded via
      risk reduction. When the option to not play is available, games with
      negative perceived expected value cannot be insured against. Take, for
      example, the double-or-nothing game offered in the introduction. The
      perceived expected value of playing the game is negative and the true
      expected value is zero. Because you are offered the option to also not
      play, however, any insurance policy that can arbitrage this difference
      would be dominated by the option to not play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, artificial insurance policies also compete with certain natural
      mitigation strategies. Additional, non-market-taking solutions include
      <a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gill53/AER12.pdf"
        >putting agents in non-competitive environments</a
      >
      or
      <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w22605.pdf"
        >reducing the amount of information that is exposed</a
      >. There are many other strategies and this area of behavioral economics
      is still actively researched, but the key takeaway is that converting
      these arbitrage opportunities to other forms of value (eg money) is not
      always as easy as selling an insurance product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of particular interest to me is how these relate to aligning agents'
      incentives, which I will talk about in a part two not-yet-published blog
      post. As a sneak peak, I view a scheme that adjusting the risk profile
      curve to match the linear curve of a business as a form of
      <strong>incentive alignment</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>What does that mean for me?</h2>
    <p>
      On a personal level, the existence of insurance and the loss aversion
      asymmetry has taught me that when I'm afraid of something, odds are that
      it's not rational. Usually, the true payoff curve is not aligned with what
      I'm afraid of. Sometimes, that helps make it easier to take risks but in
      other words,
      <strong>failing is not always as bad as it seems.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Put simply, I try to take some risks for the sake of taking them. Being a
      bit riskier usually will mean I'm closer to risk-neutral than risk-taking
      after factoring in my biases. That's how I capitalize on my personal risk
      arbitrage and collect my own risk premium without insurance.
