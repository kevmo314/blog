    <h1>Lessons from Broadcast Television</h1>
    <em>March 20th, 2021</em>
    <p>
      It's been about four months since I started
      <a href="https://twitch.tv/muxfd">my Twitch channel</a> and three months
      since I discussed
      <a href="/variety-streamers-on-twitch.html"
        >how to growth hack the category pages</a
      >. I'm proud to say that that approach does work pretty well! The effects
      are quite noticeable and have helped get me to ~30 average concurrent
      viewers. However, the effects of category hacking for larger channels is
      less apparent than I had originally thought. In this post, I'll discuss
      going from a small streamer to a mid-size, ~1k concurrent viewer channel,
      taking lessons from broadcast television that I've learned since the last
      post. I argue that at this stage, <em>when</em> you stream is more
      important than <em>what</em> you stream.
    </p>
    <h2>Raids and Dayparting</h2>

    <p>
      The parting line of
      <a href="/variety-streamers-on-twitch.html"
        >Variety Streamers on Twitch</a
      >
      is that the key to growth is <strong>exposure at all costs</strong>. For
      small and mid-size streamers, raids are likely the greatest source of
      non-organic exposure. However, in order to be raided, your stream has to
      be online to be raided! This means that it's actually more important to
      network with streamers that consistently broadcast at times just before
      your stream goes online instead of those after. Of course, networking with
      streams after is a great way to be a member of the community, but I
      believe that that's a mid to large streamer growth hack. Content for a
      future post, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a step back, a raid is similar to a TV channel's "next in line"
      program. When my favorite TV show ends, the channel keeps playing the next
      one. In essence, this is free advertising for the next show. In broadcast
      programming, the timeslotting of shows is known as
      <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayparting">dayparting</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out, Twitch viewership follows approximately the same daily,
      cyclical viewing pattern as broadcast television, so we can apply lessons
      from dayparting to Twitch to catalyze our growth.
    </p>
    <h2>Death Slots</h2>
    <p>
      The biggest lesson from broadcast television is the death slot. Shows that
      air during these slots are more likely to be cancelled due to low
      viewership. Some known death slots in broadcast television are
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_night_death_slot"
          >Friday evenings, 8p to 11p</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>Saturday nights</li>
      <li>Weekdays, 12p to 4p</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Counterintuitively, these slots aren't death slots because they don't have
      viewers, but rather that they're so dominated by existing popular channels
      that any show that is scheduled for that slot
      <strong>cannot compete</strong> for viewership. The same will happen on
      Twitch too. During these time slots, small to medium size channels have a
      difficult time competing with large channels, who draw the largest
      audiences. Check out this viewership graph when I started during a death
      slot (Tuesday mid-day) and move to an evening slot without raids.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lessons-from-broadcast-television-3.png" />
    <p>
      This effect is even more pronounced when I receive raids. The key idea is
      that streaming <em>right after</em> big streamers, with or without raids,
      is better than competing with them or streaming before them.
    </p>
    <h2>Late-night News and International Viewers</h2>
    <p>
      So, we observe that the best time to stream is right after big streamers
      when viewership is dwindling, but we're not competing with existing
      programming. How does that affect the content?
    </p>
    <p>
      In broadcast television, the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-night_news">late night</a>
      slot is dominated by a specific type of content.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Late-night shows are predominantly targeted toward younger male audiences
      (college students and people who suffer from insomnia are also a large
      audience for late night programs) and feature a common format of a male
      host delivering a stand-up comedy routine (known as a monologue) centered
      around current events, followed by several guests and a house band's
      performance.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Luckily, Twitch does not have to be so specific: it's possible to thrive
      even not catering to younger male audiences. The predominant point though,
      is that the content will need to cater to the specific audience that views
      your channel, not the audience that views the popular streamers' channels.
      Therefore, listen to your viewers. Observe what sorts of content they're
      interested in and cater to them. This will likely be different from the
      types of content that mainstream programming likes and it's important to
      latch onto that.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my case, turns out my channel has much appeal with international
      viewers. Streaming weekday afternoons after the 4p timeslot means I drive
      many evening European viewers who may be interested in exploring New York
      City. Therefore, anything related to exploration tends to do better than
      pure talking content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much like how late night television observes that its audience is young
      males, it's important to listen to your audience at this stage. There will
      likely be a specific demographic that is attracted to your channel. Build
      on that first and defer the vision of the demographic you wish to target
      for later.
    </p>
    <h2>International Streamers and the Graveyard Slot</h2>
    <p>
      All of the above observations are based on the US time schedules, how does
      that work for international streamers? Unfortunately, Twitch operates
      pretty much on a US time schedule.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lessons-from-broadcast-television-2.png" />
    <p>
      That means that international streamers have to cater to American viewers
      for growth. Most significantly, this means avoiding the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_slot"
        >overnight graveyard slot</a
      >
      between 2a and 6a. Luckily, it's not as dire as it sounds because Twitch
      is international, but generally broadcasting in this slot is the opposite
      extreme: instead of competing for viewership, streamers are broadcasting
      to minimal audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incidentally, I have also noticed that there are not many IRL streamers in
      Europe. I believe that this is because the prime broadcasting slots are
      times where Europe is dark. 10p in NYC is around 4a in Europe and there is
      not much to do at night. Similarly, 10p in NYC is around 10a in Japan,
      perfect time for daylight content when NYC is dark. As IRL streaming
      becomes more common, I anticipate this will change, but for now, streaming
      IRL content out of Europe essentially means trying to network with
      Asia-Pacific streamers for raids and not much else. There is very little
      organic traffic that can be driven during these time slots.
    </p>
    <h2>Content, Niches, and Exceptions</h2>
    <p>
      In the intro, I mentioned that <em>what</em> you stream doesn't matter,
      however above I have only argued that <em>when</em> you stream does
      matter. I haven't been able to collect as much evidence around this, but I
      hypothesize that the content actually doesn't matter so much as long as
      it's in the roughly correct direction. As long as there's something to
      watch it's better than nothing to watch. I have been experimenting with
      this and even the most mundane content is able to find traction with IRL
      streams. I believe this is due to IRL streams having an implicit character
      and thus there's a baseline level of content. It doesn't matter what I'm
      doing because I'm still a part of the show.
    </p>
    <p>
      This might not be true for non-IRL streams, but I have not found any
      evidence either way.
    </p>
    <p>
      A notable exception I have found to the above growth strategy of choosing
      timeslots wisely is super-niche content channels. Certain channels have
      content so unique that they're able to attract viewership at all hours of
      the day. I think the reason for this is because the above analysis is
      based on US viewership patterns, but when your target viewership doesn't
      behave the same the dayparted timeslots need to shift to match demand. For
      example, a channel that only caters to Japanese speakers probably doesn't
      care much about the US market.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/lessons-from-broadcast-television-4.png" />
    <p>
      The overarching point that this strategy takes advantage of is
      <strong>don't compete</strong>. Competing with big players for viewership
      will result in worse results than finding your own niche in content or
      timeslot. At this stage, it's about growing the channel, not finding the
      perfect content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, there are many other factors that are important to pay attention to:
      networking with other streamers, engaging with viewers, and leveraging
      other social media. This post intends to shine light on an understated
      method of growth that should be used in conjunction with other strategies,
      not to argue that it's the only path to success. Happy streaming!
