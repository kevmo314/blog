    <h1>On the Unreasonable Effectiveness of Finite State Machines</h1>
    <em>September 23rd, 2020</em>
    <p>
      Finite state machines are a powerful, but underutilized model for
      computation. They are the most flexible and "perfect" abstraction of how
      practical code behaves that I've run across, even moreso than my love of
      everything-is-a-function. There are more flexible models, such as Turing
      machines, but finite state machines strike a balance between being overly
      abstract and being grounded in application.
    </p>
    <p>
      A finite state machine is a <strong>machine</strong> that transitions
      between <strong>states</strong>, of which there are
      <strong>finitely many</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>A simple example</h2>
    <p>
      We'll take this example straight from Wikipedia. A door has two states:
      <strong>open</strong> and <strong>closed</strong>. Transitioning between
      them is simply <strong>opening</strong> a closed door or
      <strong>closing</strong> an open door.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/finite-state-machines-1.png" />
    <p>
      With these states and transitions, the door can be modeled as a
      <strong>finite state machine</strong>. In this example, we don't dictate
      what opens or closes the door, but we can also specify that too. For
      example, in an automatically closing door the
      <strong>closing</strong> action is simply labeled as an automatic
      transition.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/finite-state-machines-2.png" />
    <h2>Implementing a finite state machine</h2>
    <p>
      Now that we have a door, let's implement it. Some tutorials choose to use
      a library like
      <a href="https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate">XState</a>, but I think
      finite state machines can be implemented more elegantly without any
      libraries. Moreover, bare-bones implementations get to the real power of
      such models.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, declare our states. Each state is represented by a
      <code>type</code>.
    </p>
    <pre>
type OpenState = "open";
type ClosedState = "closed";

type DoorState = OpenState | ClosedState;</pre
    >
    <p>
      Second, declare our transitions. Each transition is represented by a
      <code>function</code>.
    </p>
    <pre>
function close(state: OpenState): ClosedState {
  return "closed";
}

function open(state: ClosedState): OpenState {
  return "open";
}</pre
    >
    <p>
      And that's it! To use this implementation, we can maintain our door as a
      <code>variable</code>.
    </p>
    <pre>
let door: DoorState = "open";

door = close(door); // Close the door.
door = open(door);  // Open it again.
door = open(door);  // This won't compile, can't open an open door.</pre
    >
    <p>
      Try this on the
      <a
        href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/C4TwDgpgBA8pB2BlYBDY0C8UBEB7B2A3AFCiRQDCANrgM4QAmyamOAxjfQ0caeNABFcuAE7N0ULHAhJUEgD6VOjcRBLEAZgFd4bYAEtc8KBzoQAFLTkQAXLASqAlHepmm1qAG9iUKCIjAWiLG2KZcPAC+vNq6BkZQ+DKW1i7K7izO9jKqXj5+AUEhifCRvFQBUAzCInZCojlYeATqVaKSJsrmrSKOhFAA9P1KZlDAABbQ3QB0xN3txV3Vvb6DWcb6wFAoAOYo+vAzc1gL3csDQwAqY-q0UADuRgDkm2y4ALZg+uUANCYo8M8EggtsZipVqlMgA"
        >TypeScript playground</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2>Adding complexity</h2>
    <p>
      The door example is simple, however. Practical finite state machines have
      many more states, transitions, and behaviors. But these can still be
      modeled with the above pattern. Let's consider an HTML button, which can
      be modeled with the following diagram.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/finite-state-machines-3.png" />
    <p>
      Play around with the behavior
      <a
        href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs103/cs103.1142/button-fsm/"
        >here</a
      >, taking note of how the transitions work.
    </p>
    <p>Using the above framework, first declare our states.</p>
    <pre>
type IdleUpState = "idle, up";
type IdleDownState = "idle, down";
type HoverState = "hover";
type HoverPressedState = "hover, pressed";
type HeldOutsideState = "held outside";
type PressedState = "pressed";
type FireState = "fire!";

type ButtonState = 
  | IdleUpState
  | IdleDownState
  | HoverState
  | HoverPressedState
  | HeldOutsideState
  | PressedState
  | FireState;</pre
    >
    <p>
      Then declare our transitions. I've omitted <code>leave</code>,
      <code>press</code>, and <code>release</code> to keep this readable.
    </p>
    <pre>
function enter(state: IdleUpState | IdleDownState | HeldOutsideState): ButtonState {
  switch (state) {
    case "idle, up":
      return "hover";
    case "idle, down":
      return "hover, pressed";
    case "held, outside":
      return "pressed";
  }
}

...</pre
    >
    <p>
      Unfortunately, when we try using this implementation, something goes
      wrong!
    </p>
    <pre>
let button: ButtonState = "idle, up";

button = enter(button);  // This is ok.
button = leave(button);  // This won't compile, but should.</pre
    >
    <p>
      What happened here? Sadly, the compiler doesn't know that
      <code>button</code> is a valid state when it gets passed to
      <code>leave</code>. There are three ways to solve this problem:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Separate each transition into a different function for every input
        state.
      </li>
      <li>
        Loosen the input state requirements and don't transition if an invalid
        state is passed.
      </li>
      <li>Improve the compiler.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      #1 results in a lot of boilerplate but will work and #3 is outside the
      scope of this post, so I'll focus on #2. In order to not transition if the
      state is invalid, we adjust the transition so nothing happens if an
      incorrect state is passed in.
    </p>
    <pre>
function enter(state: ButtonState): ButtonState {
  switch (state) {
    case "idle, up":
      return "hover";
    case "idle, down":
      return "hover, pressed";
    case "held, outside":
      return "pressed";
    default:
      return state;
  }
}</pre
    >
    <p>And with that simple change, our code now works.</p>
    <pre>
let button = "idle, up";

button = enter(button);  // This is ok.
button = leave(button);  // Also now works.</pre
    >
    <p>Lastly, we want to bind our transitions to events.</p>
    <pre>
let state = "idle, up";

button.on("mouseenter", () => state = enter(state));
button.on("mouseleave", () => state = enter(state));
document.on("mousedown", () => state = press(state));
document.on("mouseup", () => state = release(state));</pre
    >
    <p>
      And we're done! <code>state</code> now tracks the state of the button
      following the behavior of the state machine. Try it below, view the source
      with your browser.

          document.getElementById("state").textContent = state = release(state);
        });
      })();
    </script>
    <h2>Why is this significant?</h2>
    <p>
      Another approach to solving #2 would be to use a higher order function
      called a <code>reducer</code>. This would remove the need for default
      statements, and might look something like this.
    </p>
    <pre>
type EnterAction = "enter";
type LeaveAction = "leave";
type PressAction = "press";
type ReleaseAction = "release";

type Action =
  | EnterAction
  | LeaveAction
  | PressAction
  | ReleaseAction;

function reducer(action: Action, state: ButtonState): ButtonState {
  switch(action) {
    case "enter": {
      if (state === "idle, up" || state === "idle, down" || state === "held, outside") {
        return enter(state);
      }
      return state;
    }
    ...
  }
}</pre

    <p>
      The other cases have been omitted for brevity, but if you're familiar with
      the direction that frontend development has been going for the last few
      years, this might seem
      <a href="https://redux.js.org/">incredibly familiar</a>. This is no
      surprise: finite state machines are an incredibly good model for
      applications. UI development in general has captured a lot of this
      intuition by decoupling state representation from rendering.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we take a step back and look again at the button finite state machine
      as an example, suppose we only look at the subset of states in the red
      box.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/finite-state-machines-4.png" />
    <p>
      This is still a finite state machine! In fact, finite state machines are
      composed <em>of finite state machines</em>. And when we look at the
      implementation of <code>reducer</code>, it looks suspiciously similar to
      the code for a transition, because it is, in fact, a transition.
    </p>
    <p>
      So finite state machines are just composed of finite state machines. Take
      this to an extreme and look at a computer. A
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture"
        >von Neumann</a
      >
      architected computer is composed of memory, which stores state, and a
      processor, which performs transitions. Therefore,
      <strong
        >a physical computer is nothing but a finite state machine.</strong
      >
      Functions are nothing but transitions between memory states. And I think
      this realization is why writing a finite state machine from scratch is so
      insightful, because viewing code as nothing but state transitions offers a
      way to dramatically reduce complexity and make code easier to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finite state machines aren't just good models for computing, they are an
      <em>exceptionally good</em> model for practical software engineering. The
      next time you run into a complex problem and it's hard to rack your head
      around the complexity, try decomposing it into simple states and
      transitions between them. As we've seen, finite state machines are
      composed of finite state machines, so not only can you start by modeling a
      small subset of states and build up from there, but also every problem is
      guaranteed to be modelable.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, if it runs on a computer, it runs on a finite state machine, so
      it has to be, fundamentally, a transition between states. That is, in my
      opinion, unreasonably effective.
