    <h1>Freedom</h1>
    <em>November 23rd, 2022. Happy Thanksgiving again :)</em>
    <p>
      I've noticed that it's sometimes difficult to push something out the door.
      Call it launch anxiety, writer's block, creativity slump, whatever.
      Curiously, it's also a lot easier to publish something when nobody is
      watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog, for example. For all intents and purposes, few people actually
      read it. It doesn't go viral on Hacker News, it doesn't offer some
      utility, and it's not some shining beacon of persona that thousands flock
      to. It's strange that so often I would hope that all of the above would be
      true and yet, I'm proud of my blog. These posts that don't go anywhere.
    </p>

      When I started my Twitch channel, I was also proud of it. In fact, I'm
      envious of being a new streamer. I remember the excitement of starting
      something new, the thrill of the unknown, and the joy of exploring and
      learning. As my channel grew though, so did my expectations. I wanted to
      see continued growth and wanted to figure out how to make it happen. The
      truth is, I have some ideas, but I still think by far the largest factor
      is just streaming more. In other words, I don't really know what makes big
      streamers interesting.

      In 2004, WIRED posted an article about the
      <a href="https://www.wired.com/2004/10/tail/"
        >long tail of entertainment</a
      >
      and how the vast majority of content is not the top hits. It seems like
      most of us are actually alone, with a little stretching of the definition
      of the word. This disparity is true across all types of platforms:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://sullygnome.com/channels/30/metadata"
          >99% of Twitch creators</a
        >
        stream to zero to five viewers
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/01/02/patreon-content-creators-monthly-minimum-wage/"
          >Less than 2% of Patreon creators</a
        >
        earn more than minimum wage
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.tubics.com/blog/number-of-youtube-channels"
          >Less than 3% of YouTube channels</a
        >
        have more than 1k subscribers
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1166139/usa-tiktok-influencer-distribution-number-followers/"
          >Fewer than 5% of TikTokers</a
        >
        have more than 100k followers
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      How can we overcome that gap? Ali Abdaal has a great video about what
      makes people successful and the book:
      <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Unfair-Advantage-Already-Takes-Succeed/dp/B09GCYXJ2S/"
        >The Unfair Advantage</a
      >. A crucial point is adopting a <strong>growth mindset</strong>: a
      mindset in which we're always learning from feedback.
    </p>

      frameborder="0"
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
      allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    <p>
      But in environments where we're alone, how can we get feedback? With that
      bleak of a distribution, how are we to get feedback? How are we find any
      type of traction and learn when we're receiving scraps of feedback
      compared to the top?
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe when we adopt a growth mindset, when we focus solely on growing and
      getting feedback, we actually give up freedom. This isn't to say we should
      adopt a fixed mindset, but rather that I think there's a lot of solace in
      building in isolation without expectation. It's still
      <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33713072"
        >important to be pleasant to others</a
      >
      and see opportunities, I'm not advocating for becoming a hermit, but
      feedback isn't a holy grail it's chalked up to be: effective scales of
      feedback are only really accessible to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, how am I supposed to know if my writing is good and growing if
      there's nobody to tell me? What's the point of streaming to zero viewers?
    </p>
    <p>
      And just like that, creating becomes a lot more existential. It's not
      about the art anymore, it's about whether it's sustainable. Suddenly,
      because I'm governed by the almighty cycles of feedback, I'm not as
      isolated anymore and consequentially, I'm not as free.

      I think the answer is that there's no point. There's no point in
      publishing to zero readers, there's no point in streaming to zero viewers,
      and there's no point in creating to zero listeners. But there is a point
      in creating for the sake of creating. There is a point in creating for the
      sake of freedom. Does that mean it's not possible to grow? No, but maybe
      focusing on growth is a luxury that only the top can afford.

      I think this is why I'm so proud of my blog. It's a place where I can be
      free to write whatever I want, without the pressure of an audience.
      Actually, is that even true? Maybe I'm just proud of this blog because I
      assume nobody reads it but I really have no idea. There aren't analytics
      on here. Is success the price of freedom?

      PS: When writing this post, GitHub Copilot had my back. It is oddly
      comforting to me to know that a robot is listening.
