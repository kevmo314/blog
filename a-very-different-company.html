    <h1>A Very Different Company</h1>
    <em>November 26th, 2020 -- Happy Thanksgiving to everyone in the US :)</em>
    <p>
      When I applied to MBA programs late last year, they asked me what my
      vision of the world was. Many candidates spoke about social equality,
      environmental sustainability, economic mobility, among other topics. I've
      been thinking about something different: a different kind of company.
    </p>
    <h2>A brief history of corporations</h2>
    <p>
      The first recorded corporations were in China: merchants who profit-shared
      with investors, introducing the idea of corporations as a means to reduce
      risk. In the 1300's, Bazacle Milling Company
      <a href="https://qz.com/219270/bazacle/"
        >developed the first tradable shares</a
      >, decoupling the price of the share from the underlying profit to allow
      for speculation. Then in 1602, the Dutch East India Company issued
      publically tradable shares on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, broadening the
      scope of potential investors to become the first public company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the course of a thousand years, corporations have gained incremental
      improvements to broaden their ability to reduce risk and increase profits
      by raising capital. Since the Dutch East India Company, however, there
      hasn't been a huge amount of development. Generally, modern corporate
      structure follows quite closely to the models of these prototypical
      corporations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I'm not one to reinvent the wheel: this corporate structure works
      because it allows raising capital to build far more than any individual
      could ever build. But since the 1600's, we've learned a lot about how
      markets and humans behave. Indeed, modern behavioral economics has
      designed mechanisms to align incentives between individuals. Modern psychology has deepened insights
      into how decisions are made. Our understanding of human behavior is leaps and bounds better.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe the next big incremental improvement will be how corporations
      employ individuals.
    </p>
    <h2>The coproduct</h2>
    <p>Consider the following situation:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I have a product</li>
      <li>I need to find a customer to sell it to</li>
      <li>I advertise to the market to identify potential sales</li>
      <li>The product is sold through a trade of goods and money</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This sounds like a pretty standard business lifecycle, right?
      Interestingly, it also applies to hiring.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>I have a position I need to fill</li>
      <li>I need to find an employee willing to fill it</li>
      <li>I recruit on the market to identify potential candidates</li>
      <li>The job is completed through a trade of services and money</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The insight is that businesses are fundamentally products. Companies need
      to market their appeal to candidates in the same way they market products.
      In this sense, corporations <em>are</em> products. A product that produces
      a product. In a slight nod to category theory, I call this "business
      product" the <strong>coproduct</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corporations that can identify product-market fit are able to capture more
      of the market for the product. Similarly, corporations that can market to
      employees can capture more of the labor market for the coproduct. Without
      a coproduct there can be no product and vice versa. Significantly, both
      must exist by construction as modern corporations always have a governance
      structure and therefore always have a coproduct.
    </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Why hasn't this been realized yet?</strong> I'm not completely
        sure. I haven't been able to find anyone who views companies through
        this lens. I think historically jobs were always in limited supply as
        the ratio of companies to people is always less than 1. Even now, among
        low and mid skill workers, companies typically have the advantage.
        Employee unions are developed to counteract this advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, when companies have the advantage, they don't need to "market"
        their position as heavily because demand is always there, so perhaps
        this lens was simply overlooked. It is only now that we see companies,
        especially in tech, looking at culture fit because the demand for
        engineering talent is very high compared to supply. It's no coincidence
        that culture fit and product-market fit are very similar.
      </p>
    </small>
    <hr />
    <h2>Coproduct-market fit</h2>
    <p>
      For every product, there's a user of the product. Who are the users of the
      coproduct? From the above example, the employees. So we can take all of
      our insights from product development and apply them to employees.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <em>
        Focus on the user and all else will follow. --
        <a href="https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html">Google</a>
      </em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Surprisingly, they're both applicable and romantic.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <em
        >Getting product right means finding product/market fit. It does not
        mean launching the product. It means getting to the point where the
        market accepts your product and wants more of it. --

        ></em
      >
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A coproduct is doing well when it has captured hiring. Some businesses,
      such as Google's early days, have been able to attract talent like this:
      by achieving fit with engineering culture they foster a strong desire to
      work there. But as companies grow, they often lose sight of the need to
      maintain this culture fit because they focus too much on the product and
      let the coproduct atrophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without product-market fit, a company will never be able to sell its
      products. Without culture fit, a company will never be able to hire
      employees for its coproduct. Both are necessary as growth is derived from
      the success of the combination, not just each individually. However,
      conventionally companies tend to hire based on their preconceived notions
      of culture. This is akin to selling a product independent of
      product-market fit. Real culture fit should be like product-market fit.
      It needs to be sought out, identified, and developed, not just asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concretely, this means that companies must care about their employees.
      They must work hard to retain talent and identify opportunities to improve
      employee relations. Employees must be incentivized to act in the benefit
      of the company much in the same way that users of a product shouldn't be
      able to exploit a company.
    </p>

        people don’t know what they want until you show it to them. -- Steve

      >
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Where do investors fit in in this model? I liken the role of investors to
      a supply chain for the coproduct. Much in the way businesses interact with
      third-party supply chains to develop their product, businesses may
      interact with third-party investors to develop their coproduct. Therefore,
      it's important not just to find an investor, but also one that shares the
      same fundamental principles that the business embodies. Perhaps the
      business cares about supply chain sustainability. Does it care about its
      investor sustainability? It's up to each business to determine which
      supply chain is right for its product, therefore it's also important to
      determine which investor is right for its coproduct.
    </p>
    <h2>Corporate governance</h2>
    <p>
      A nice consequence of this lens is also the implications it has on
      corporate officers. Someone once mentioned to me that the real job of top
      level leaders is to just approve decisions, not make them. The best
      leaders are the ones who delegate decisions. Under this new company lens,
      that type of delegation makes perfect sense:
      <strong
        >officers work on the coproduct, employees work on the product.</strong
      >
      It makes very little sense for officers to make decisions on the product
      when that's not even part of their organization!
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the sole role of an officer is to ensure that the coproduct, the
      marketability of the business itself, is maximized. Otherwise, they are
      confounding their role with that of an employee.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <small>
      <p>
        A lot of investors say "we invest in teams" or similar. Through this
        lens it's also a little more clear why this works: they're not investing
        in teams, they're investing in products. They're investing in the
        coproduct.
      </p>
    </small>
    <hr />
    <p>
      When I think of conventional organizational charts, it's quite funny that
      officers sit at the top. In reality, officers don't sit at the top, they
      sit on a parallel tree. It's the high level and mid-level managers who are
      really at the top. Modern conglomerates have hinted at this structure, for
      example Alphabet has an independent management chain for the
      conglomeration over each of the independent entities.

    <h2>My MBA interview</h2>
    <p>
      Investors sometimes ask what our five to ten year vision is. In some
      sense, I don't really care. What I care about is building a lasting
      company: the best coproduct in the world. A product might change the world
      for the next five years until the next one comes along because most
      companies compete on product.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want companies to compete on the coproduct. That might change the world
      forever.

      that <strong>it's time to build</strong> in an almost cathartic
      proclamation against this declining innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it's time to build. It always has been. But it's not just time
      to build. It's been four hundred years since the last big change in the
      way corporations work. By realizing the coproduct, I hypothesize that
      we'll see another leap in productivity the same way that early
      corporations facilitated massive growth through investment. Focusing on
      the coproduct strengthens a new growth loop.
    </p>
    <p>It's time for a paradigm shift.</p>
    <p>
      As I mentioned behavioral economics has given us a wealth of research that
      can be incorporated into how businesses work. Much like product design,
      employees won't often tell us exactly what they want. It's up to us to
      figure out what that is.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does this all mean concretely? I have ideas around hiring structure,
      team building, and compensation that fall out of this lens, but that's
      another blog post for another day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't end up getting into any MBA programs. Perhaps my ideas at the
      time were too vague and abstract. I only had complaints about what didn't
      work, not ideas about what might work. I applied because I wanted to find
      out if these ideas made sense. But it's okay, since then I've instead
      cofounded my own company to see if these ideas work.
    </p>
    <p>If they do, I don't think I'll need an MBA anymore.</p>
