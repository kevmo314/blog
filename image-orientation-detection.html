    <p>Given a picture, is it right side up?</p>

      I thought this would be a pretty easy problem to solve, but turns out it
      required more work than I expected. I ended up using a convolutional
      neural network to solve this problem. In the past, I always used neural
      networks with predefined problems, problems that I knew could be solved
      with machine learning, but this was the first time I came up with the
      problem and solution!
