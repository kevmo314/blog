    <h1>The Hardest Part is Showing Up</h1>
    <em>April 6th, 2022</em>
    <p>
      This week I was watching a YouTube video of a guy making an epoxy table.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later in the video, he mentions a quote, something along the lines of
      "everything in life is a pain", which is also a pinned comment*. Much of
      the world projects that image today. Hacker News is full of posts
      lamenting how ridiculously complex software engineering is. Startups and
      their recruiters constantly advertise that they're solving
      <em>hard problems</em> and <em>making an impact</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've definitely bought into this mentality. "I want to work for a company
      that solves hard problems," I thought after college. After all, solving
      hard problems means having an impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if having an impact is <strong>easy</strong>? "If it were easy,
      everyone would be doing it" I hear. But everyone is. Our friends have jobs
      and they're "making an impact" even if it's democratizing the checkout
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anyone asks me about riding a bike 100 miles, the exchange typically
      goes like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Wow, you rode a bike 100 miles? That must've been really hard!"</li>
      <li>
        "Actually it wasn't that bad, it just took a long time. I think you
        could probably do it too."
      </li>
      <li>
        "I definitely couldn't! I haven't even ridden more than ten miles!"
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Most of my friends believe they can't ride a bike 100 miles. Most believe
      they probably couldn't run a marathon. And yet, most marathoners I've
      asked would say that the average person can finish a marathon without too
      much training or trouble. I'd say that the first mile is more difficult
      than going from 10 to 100 miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Posting a competitive time? That's a different question. But actually
      finishing isn't hard. Unfortunately, after believing that they can't, none
      of my non-biking friends are willing to try.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow this is obvious to me when biking but not so much when working.
      The hardest part of my daily work is not actually solving the problems in
      front of me, it's <em>opening the IDE and getting started</em>. It's easy
      for me to get lost watching what everyone else is doing and forget what I
      wanted for myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think "I'm doing something hard" makes for an easy excuse or crutch for
      me to avoid chasing where I want to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd like to get better at this. I want to believe that I'm solving easy
      problems. Not to belittle my work but if I believe that the progress I
      make is easy, then I can make more progress towards where I want to go. I
      want to find people who believe in the same: that we can do anything and
      it's not that hard. People who want to show up instead of finding excuses
      thinly veiled as "reasons".
    </p>
    <p>And maybe one day we might accidentally solve something that is hard.</p>
    <p>
      One day we'll reach 100 miles but I'm not going to let the first mile stop
      me.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      * I do this quote a bit of a disservice. In the video, he argues that
      accepting that what we do is hard makes them easier to do. This isn't that
      dissimilar from my belief, but I think believing that the things I do are
      easy helps me progress further instead of being content with the progress
      I've made.
