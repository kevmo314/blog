    <h1>A Love Letter to Games</h1>
    <em>October 17th, 2020</em>
    <p>
      During pitches, I have to give a short blurb about my background. This is
      the story I wish I could tell.
    </p>
    <h2>Act I: Video Games</h2>
    <p>
      Like many kids, I learned how to code through video games. On February
      11th, 2005, I sat in our kitchen while my parents cooked dinner. My dad
      was watching a show called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Screen_Savers"
        >The Screen Savers</a
      >
      on a small CRT TV, the kind that tickled your fingers if you touched the
      screen after turning it off. That day, they talked about a game called
      <a href="http://blockland.us/">Blockland</a>.
    </p>
    <video controls>
      <source src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
    <p>
      A big Lego fan myself, I jumped to install this game and immediately got
      addicted. I fell in love with the infinite creativity of a building
      sandbox and the ability to talk with complete strangers who were all
      excited by building. We'd spend hours making jokes with each other,
      building skyscrapers, and coming up with puzzles. The same way Lego
      captivates my imagination, Blockland did so without burning a hole in my
      parent's wallet. Blockland predated Minecraft by about six years, but I
      think many kids fall in love with Minecraft for the same reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blockland also had a
      <a href="https://forum.blockland.us/">community forum</a>: a place where
      people would post their creations and talk about life, but most
      importantly for me, talk about how to modify the game. You see, when
      people love something, they want to make it better. I wanted to make
      Blockland better.
    </p>
    <p>One day I discovered a guide to modifying the game.</p>
    <p>
      The first beginnings were simple. Windows Notepad, manual indentation.
      Hours of syntax errors, asking my dad what a variable was. Boundless
      frustration, but all worth it for that dopamine rush when it actually
      works and the new Lego bow I had imagined was working on the screen in
      front of me. And more importantly, because it was a game, I could share
      with everyone else who loved it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out, seven years later those mods still stood the test of time, long
      after the era of CRT TVs.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-2.png" />
    <p>
      My favorite mod that I wrote was called <em>Custom Shifting</em>.
      Blockland operated in a discretized three-dimensional world, but the
      Torque Game Engine it was built on was a fully-featured 3D engine. Some
      modders realized this and added a feature that allowed setting the exact
      orientation of a block. I took this mod one step further and allowed
      players to scale, transform, and rotate with their keyboard, effectively
      turning Blockland into a rudimentary 3D modeling program.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mod was also the best geometry lesson I had ever gotten. I actually
      asked my geometry teacher how to do rotations about an arbitrary point via
      matrix multiplication in rectangular coordinates. He told me that I should
      convert everything to polar, do the transformation, then convert it back
      to rectangular. I don't remember much else from that class (sorry Mr
      Stuckey) but I definitely remember that conversation. Turns out I had
      invented something similar to features in real 3D modeling programs like
      Blender.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-8.png" />
    <p>
      I wish I had the foresight to screenshot the insanely creative structures
      people made. Everything from racecars to roller coasters, statues to
      skyscrapers. People began twisting and turning blocks, shaping and molding
      them to fit their imaginations. I remember after releasing the mod,
      suddenly the bar for creativity skyrocketed as everyone had
      millimeter-grained control over their Lego bricks' positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm still proud of the code I wrote because it was my first taste of
      seeing how I could impact a community with just an idea. Video games
      taught me that I could create anything I wanted to with the right logic.
    </p>
    <h2>Act II: Web Games</h2>
    <p>
      Blockland's community was small though. It wasn't until Neopets,
      Runescape, and Maplestory that I'd realize how much games influenced
      larger communities. The botting communities behind these games were huge!
      Hundreds of thousands of kids coming together to figure out how to
      automate their games to gain an advantage. Auto-chat spammers,
      auto-clickers, boss battle winners, you name it. And the platforms kept
      trying to detect us too. It was sort of an arms race between kids who
      barely knew what HTML was and actual, established engineers.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-3.jpg" />
    <p>
      I'd hack together some
      <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a> scripts with some
      basic image detection and let them run overnight or while I was at school.
      I'd actually publish some of these bots and others would constantly try to
      improve them with more fervor than any GitHub pull request I've seen. It
      was really like trying to build software without having ever learned how
      to code, but crazily it worked! Whatever crazy ideas I had to save myself
      from having to manually level up were just a few lines of code away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web games were also where I managed to start my first actual business.
      From these scripts, I grew to about $500k in annualized revenue at the
      peak. Sometimes I miss the simpler days of hacking scripts together and
      shipping them out. I never wrote tests: I didn't even know what they were.
      I just implemented whatever idea landed in front of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web games taught me that I had the ability to influence a lot of people
      with the right choices. My code didn't even have to be good, it just had
      to be useful.
    </p>
    <h2>Act III: Alternate Reality Games</h2>
    <p>
      When I moved to college, I started to outgrow the online games I played.
      But gaming always stuck with me. I quickly became the creator of
      UChicago's Humans vs Zombies game, an alternate reality game played on
      campus. You can find a more detailed account of the game's history and
      structure over
      <a
        href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/kevin-wang/a-brief-history-of-zombies-at-uchicago/10156595334907727/"
        >at this post</a
      >, but not that much differently from video and web games, I really had no
      idea how to run the game and just dove right in.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-4.jpg" />
    <p>
      Our team made it work, however. We strove to focus on individual players
      and try to make the experience amazing for everyone. Over the course of my
      tenure running the game, we grew the game from zero to 400 players, which
      was about 10% of the undergraduate population at the time. Some of our
      events had way better turnout than I could've ever imagined when I
      matriculated, with hundreds of students running across the quad chasing
      each other in a chaotic version of tag. It was exciting to see that I was
      just trying to have some fun and in the process, I found others having fun
      with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what struck me the most was the impact that HvZ had on some of the
      players. Some players said that HvZ was how they found friends. Others
      said that HvZ helped them get through depression. We had built a game that
      got even the most anti-social UChicagoans to have a bit of social life.
      The key was in figuring out how to structure the game so they could build
      the social life that they wanted, not the frat parties imposed on them by
      society.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I hope you read this and other stories of HvZ players and understand that
      it has helped a lot of people be happy in a school that struggles with
      depression. --anonymous player
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Alternate reality games taught me that focusing on game design and
      incentives instead of just telling people what to do can catalyze some
      truly magical moments in the community. I'm really proud of HvZ and to
      this day strive to have the same impact on people that I did in college.
    </p>
    <h2>Act IV: Formal Games</h2>
    <p>
      Besides HvZ, while at UChicago one of my favorite classes was introductory
      game theory. From Prisoner's dilemma to Bayesian games, the idea that
      interactions between players could be modeled and analyzed was astounding.
      Suddenly, so many of the interactions I saw, emergent behaviors and
      choices that people made, could be justified from the simple framework of
      a game.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-5.png" />
    <p>
      It was also right about the time when I was at UChicago that Dr Richard
      Thaler's
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">nudge theory</a>
      started to gain traction. To me, this theory was revolutionary. All the
      economics I had learned before suggested that the best way to influence
      behavior was through direct incentives: taxes and subsidies. But here,
      behavioral economics was saying that another way to influence behavior was
      through small structural changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nudge theory gave credibility our theory for why HvZ worked so well. It
      wasn't just that the game was entertaining: that in itself wouldn't have
      made people socialize. Humans vs Zombies helped people socialize because
      it changed their underlying perception of the world just slightly. It
      nudged them towards cooperating with others to make it to their next class
      alive. It gave them a subtle cues via a colorful bandana to help people
      find others who also cared about avoiding zombies. It enabled conversation
      topics around heroic rescues and daring escapes.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      if you want to get somebody to do something, make it easy --Dr Richard
      Thaler
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Formal game theory showed me that the impact I had with games wasn't a
      fluke or luck, it was actually something structural and could be studied.
      It showed me that with a bit of study and care about the structures of the
      games, then games like Humans vs Zombies can be designed, engineered, and
      improved. That the unfortunate Nash equilibria could be mitigated by
      nudging prior beliefs.
    </p>
    <h2>Act V: Social Games</h2>
    <p>
      These days, I spend my time on <a href="https://doahuddle.com">Huddle</a>.
      I'm captivated by the idea that technology can connect people and I
      believe that video is a medium that far outclasses any other text-based or
      image-based forum we've seen. Video has a way of humanizing and connecting
      people in a way that is only rivaled by meeting them in person. The only
      reason I think video can offer something unique compared to an in-person
      meeting comes down to a nudge: it's easier to hop on video.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-6.jpg" style="max-width: 50%" />
    <p>
      So then the question comes down to: how can we build a video platform that
      emulates meeting people as close as possible? I don't want to build a
      platform that offers artificial connections or tries to be the only place
      to connect, I want video to simply nudge people in the right direction to
      enable them to build those connections on their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spend a lot of my time thinking about my experiences with both playing
      and building games. I see the potential of platforms like Twitch to
      <a
        href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/16/17569520/twitch-streamers-zero-viewers-motivation-community"
        >catalyze the same feelings</a
      >
      of connection that I saw with HvZ. I think the right approach to a
      successful platform will involve a bit of game theory and a bit of luck to
      keep incentives aligned. Otherwise, we're just shooting in the dark and
      hoping to be successful.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Szélesy says he grew up feeling isolated, largely spending time in front
      of the glow of a computer. "[I streamed to] escape loneliness and
      depression," he said. While he has mostly been streaming without an
      audience, every so often an errant person will drop by and stick around.
      Even if this person never comes back — and they often don’t — the small
      spark is enough to keep Szélesy going. --<a
        href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/16/17569520/twitch-streamers-zero-viewers-motivation-community"
        >The Verge</a
      >
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Hopefully, I'll find that building these social games works. I'd love to
      see game theory take a more prominent role in our decision making and I'm
      out to prove that it works. With the tech industry grappling with AI and
      its ramifications, I believe the right answer towards a better world is
      just a small, engineered nudge away.
    </p>
    <h2>Act VI: The End Game</h2>
    <p>
      Games have always played a special role in my life. They've captivated my
      imagination, influenced how I see the world, and formalized the changes I
      want to make. The ways that games can bring people together, both directly
      and indirectly, remains an area that I wish were better understood.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-7.jpg" style="max-width: 50%" />
    <p>
      And despite thinking more about structuring games, I still play games. As
      of writing, I've been playing
      <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/">Valorant</a>, loving the
      sports-like strategy and communication involved with a team.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all these years, I've discovered my love for studying incentives and
      probabilistic game theory and finding new ways to build games to foster
      community and connection. I haven't found a formalism yet for why games
      work so well, but there's always time for another act.
