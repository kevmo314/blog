      There's something peculiar about the most popular Twitch streamers. Take a

      Notice any patterns? Perhaps the one that the title hints at?
      <strong>8/10 of the top streamers stream variety content.</strong> Among
      the top 50, 20 of them are labelled as streaming
      <strong>various games</strong>. One explanation for this is that playing
      one game is boring and gaming skill transfers pretty well, so it's easy to
      just stream more games. In this post, I'll explore an alternate insight:
      one that involves how Twitch ranks streams.
    </p>
    <h2>Small streamers, small categories</h2>
    <p>
      One tip I often see
      <a href="http://reddit.com/r/twitch">r/twitch</a> give to new streamers is
      to try and find niche games and build a following there. The justification
      is that it's difficult to be at the top of a category when competing in
      the more popular ones. Let's consider <strong>Just Chatting</strong>:
    </p>
    <img src="/images/variety-streamers-on-twitch-1.png" />
    <p>
      Only one channel with less than 100 concurrent viewers was able to break
      into "above the fold"! Indeed, in the entire category, there are
      <em>thousands</em> of streamers. In order for a new streamer to have any
      chance, they have to be quite lucky in getting new viewers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out, this actually does happen. Some viewers scroll pretty far below
      the fold to find those with a low number of viewers, but it's not a
      particularly reliable way to gather viewers. Instead, consider a much
      smaller category: Zwift.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/variety-streamers-on-twitch-2.png" />
    <p>
      If I stream Zwift, I'm pretty much guaranteed to show up on the front page
      above the fold. There's only two streamers! So if I start, I'll take up
      1/3rd of the category. Now, you might ask,
      <strong>who actually clicks on the Zwift category?</strong> It's a super
      niche game, and many people probably haven't even heard of it. Turns out,
      22.9K people are following Zwift and on mobile, it's placed pretty
      prominently.
    </p>
    <img
      src="/images/variety-streamers-on-twitch-3.png"
      style="height: 500px"
    />
    <p>
      And 22.9K people have this tiny game prominently on their home screen,
      above their followers' channels! I'm by no means a big streamer, but
      Twitch provides some channel insights. Turns out, about 27% of my viewers
      come from organic discovery, which at my scale (~10 viewers/stream) pretty
      much means they came from category discovery.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/variety-streamers-on-twitch-4.png" />
    <p>
      The mobile-boosting theory is also corroborated by around the same
      fraction being on mobile, however this might also be due to the ambient
      population having that platform breakdown.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/variety-streamers-on-twitch-5.png" />
    <p>
      Nevertheless, I hypothesize that it's not a coincidence: mobile viewers
      are more likely to discover small streamers due to the current Twitch
      layout. But that's okay! For small streamers, it's much easier to get some
      amount of traction by streaming to smaller categories.
    </p>
    <h2>Growing beyond the category</h2>
    <p>
      Now, certainly there's not much of a market if I only stream Zwift. I'd be
      incredibly lucky to capture all 22.9K followers, but even then that pales
      in comparison to the millions of followers the top streamers have. To
      bridge this gap, we look to the second discovery mechanism that Twitch
      offers: following notifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking again to my viewer breakdown, 49% of my views are from existing
      followers.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/variety-streamers-on-twitch-4.png" />
    <p>
      Especially on web, they're proudly listed at the top left of the page. If
      someone is following me, I'll likely show up on the top left. Even better,
      the more viewers I have the higher I show up on the list, so big channels
      get even more exposure to followers.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/variety-streamers-on-twitch-6.png" />
    <p>
      Followers don't care about category. When I click on Myth's channel, I
      never see what category he's streaming to. Therefore, as a small streamer,
      if I capture enough of the Zwift "market" and gain some followers, I can
      jump to another game and capture some more followers, and rinse and
      repeat. Everyone comes along for the ride. Vertical segmentation!
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out, Zwift is a bit of a novelty here. There are actually quite a
      few categories with a large number of streams but not many viewers or
      followers. So category choice matters quite a bit. The best channel is the
      one where I sit above the fold.
    </p>
    <h2>Exploiting the algorithm: IRL streams</h2>
    <p>
      Okay, so now you're wondering: I don't want to stream games I don't like
      to play. That's a totally fair view! The categories for IRL streaming,
      however, are a bit unique. Unlike video games, it's very possible to fit
      into multiple categories at once. Let's look at the 14 IRL categories on
      Twitch.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/variety-streamers-on-twitch-7.png" />
    <p>
      I stream biking. I could easily justify my stream as falling under
      <strong>Fitness & Health</strong>, <strong>Special Events</strong>,
      <strong>Sports</strong>, and <strong>Travel &amp; Outdoors</strong>. Then,
      when I'm coding, I can definitely justify streaming under
      <strong>Science &amp; Technology</strong>, and maybe
      <strong>Makers &amp; Crafting</strong> or
      <strong>Talk Shows &amp; Podcasts</strong>. In both cases, of course I can
      stream to the big fish <strong>Just Chatting</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now we arrive at the approach to grow a channel as fast as possible,
      observing that among the categories I can pick from, my best options are
      those where I rank at the top. I don't want to compete in
      <strong>Just Chatting</strong>, but I can definitely compete in
      <strong>Fitness &amp; Health</strong>.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Guess how many views your content will have based on past streams and
        current number of followers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Find the category with the highest number of followers for which you'll
        rank as among the top channels in that category.
      </li>
      <li>Stream to that category, rinse and repeat!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This approach will maximize the number of category followers who will see
      your channel, increasing the organic discovery rate of your content.
    </p>
    <h2>Does it work?</h2>
    <p>
      We'll find out! I started streaming a month ago, and only seriously
      streamed since last week. Fundamentally, this approach exploits the
      algorithm to increase <strong>exposure</strong>. Going back to the top
      streamers all streaming variety content, I have a hunch that streaming
      variety content not only keeps it more interesting, but also increases
      exposure as they're able to stream to more categories and get more views,
      using their follower base to boost them to the top of big categories. For
      example, if Myth (~1K+ viewers/stream) suddenly started streaming in
      <strong>Science &amp; Technology</strong> talking about his gaming setup
      or really anything, he would probably get a lot of new organic views that
      <strong>Valorant</strong> wouldn't provide and a good fraction of them
      would convert to new followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting the most eyeballs on your channel will maximize followers. Being
      an IRL streamer also offers a unique advantage for small streamers too: I
      can stream snipe someone else in NYC and show up on their stream. This
      worked pretty well for me with
      <a href="https://twitch.tv/miekii">Miekii's stream</a>, I went from 20
      followers to 43! For growing a channel, exposure is the name of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, there are other considerations: growing community, engaging
      viewers, external promotion, and generally talking with everyone helps
      gain followers. But this approach can be done on top of all of that. After
      two weeks, I made it to Twitch affiliate! Let's see how long it takes me
      to get to partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, a tip going from zero viewers, since zero is always at the bottom:
      get your friends to join. Even if they join just for a bit, that boost
      above the fold helps a lot.
