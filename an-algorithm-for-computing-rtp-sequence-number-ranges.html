      have a sequence number associated with each packet to indicate the order
      in which the packets should be arranged. When they are sent over the
      network, they can often come out-of-order despite being sent in the
      correct order. On the receiver, some feedback mechanisms require sending
      information back to the sender to indicate which packets have been
      received. This requires computing the "range" of the sequence number seen
      over a time window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, this algorithm is not trivial because the sequence number
      is only 16-bits of information, therefore it will often wrap around. For
      example, it is easy to see that if the sequence numbers received are
      <code>[10, 11, 12, 14]</code>, the range is <code>[10, 14]</code>, however
      when the sequence numbers are <code>[65534, 65535, 0, 1, 2]</code>, it is
      a little less trivial to find the correct range <code>[65534, 2]</code>,
      especially when the packets arrive out of order.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, we seek an algorithm that is able to compute the range of
      a bounded set of numbers in <strong>quotient space.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Outline</h2>
    <p>To approach this problem, we observe two facts</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The sequence number range is bounded, typically as a constrant of the
        feedback mechanism. Feedback mechanisms typically do not permit sequence
        number ranges to exceed, eg 16384, in length. Define this bound as
        <code>B</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Given a bound <code>B</code>, we wish to find the first sequence number
        <code>seq_0</code> such that <code>seq_i &lt; seq_0 + B</code> for all
        sequence numbers. Note that addition here is under modulo arithmetic.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Given the second observation, let us define
      <code>delta_i = seq_i - seq_0</code> under
      <strong>non-modular</strong> arithmetic. That is, <code>delta_i</code> can
      be negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our algorithm observes that the start of the range is
      <code>seq_0 + min(delta_i)</code> and the end of the range is
      <code>seq_0 + max(delta_i)</code> with this addition performed in modular
      arithmetic.
    </p>
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      The implementation given the above outline is fairly straightforward. The
      main trick is in the conversion into a larger unsigned integer space. The
      algorithm is implemented in Go as follows:
    </p>
    <code>
      <pre>
minDelta := 0
maxDelta := 0
seq0 := seqs[0]
for _, seq := range seqs {
  delta := int(seq-seq0)
  if seq-seq0 >= B {
    delta -= (1<<16)
    if delta < minDelta {
      minDelta = delta
    }
  } else {
    if delta > maxDelta {
      maxDelta = delta
    }
  }
}
return seq0 + uint16(minDelta), seq0 + uint16(maxDelta)</pre
      >
    </code>
    <p>
      If unfamiliar, <code>int32()</code> converts a <code>uint16</code> into a
      signed at-least-32-bits integer.
    </p>
    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <p>
      Observe that <code>seq_i = (seq_0 + delta_i) % (2^16)</code>. We also know
      that <code>min(delta_i) &lt;= delta_i &lt;= max(delta_i)</code>. Therefore
      it must be true that <code>seq_i</code> falls within the range
      <code>[seq_0 - min(delta_i), seq_0 + max(delta_i)]</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interestingly, the choice of <code>seq_0</code> here is largely arbitrary.
      However, it is important that the choice of pivot lies within the sequence
      range for this algorithm to work. Therefore, an arbitrary sequence number
      is a natural choice.
