    <h1>Twitch: Essentially Tinder</h1>
    <em>May 27th, 2021</em>
    <p>
      It's the next chapter of Kevin's quest to figure out how IRL streaming
      works! Now, I'm up to ~150 organic concurrents, starting all the way from
      zero. My past <a href="/variety-streamers-on-twitch.html">two</a>
      <a href="/lessons-from-broadcast-television.html">posts</a> have covered
      non-content approaches to growing your channel. Today, I'll be covering
      carefully choosing your content to cater to your channel. I argue that by
      treating Twitch similar to Tinder, you can grow your channel to ~5k
      concurrent viewers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at some
      <a href="https://swipelife.tinder.com/post/using-tinder"
        >top Tinder tips</a
      >
      from Tinder and learn from them.
    </p>
    <h2>Tip 1. Make plans quickly.</h2>
    <p>
      Viewers should have an immediate first impression and get drawn in at any
      point in time during the stream. When someone joins, they want to make a
      decision quickly. Unfortunately, this means slower times and down times
      tend to churn new viewers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that's okay! Don't fret about always being in the action. Unlike
      Tinder, it's easy to rack up thousands of new impressions per stream, as
      viewers will organically discover you. Where this does matter is
      <strong>raids:</strong> it's important to make a strong first impression
      with raids. Pay attention to the kind of content and the response you get
      from a raid. Sometimes, the content will align, perhaps the viewers are
      predisposed to be interested in your content or perhaps you can appeal to
      them in the brief moments after the raid. Some of the viewers will stay
      for the entire stream. With decent content alignment, this is what the
      viewer graph should look like.

    <p>And here's a graph of viewers with bad content alignment.</p>
    <img src="/images/twitch-essentially-tinder-2.png" />
    <p>
      When all of your raiding viewers are lost to attrition, see if there's
      anything you can change to appeal to them in those first crucial moments.
      Make a good first impression and <strong>make plans quickly.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Tip 2. Put an icebreaker in your profile.</h2>
    <p>
      Tinder suggests that you should make it easy for people to reach out with
      a message. On Twitch, that means make it easy for people to chat. Create
      topics, engage with viewers, and interact with them. Give people an easy
      reason to chat and they'll come back.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Another way to break the ice is to include interesting photos that spark a
      reaction.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Some streamers do this by engaging with everyone. For example, I make it a
      point to try to not miss anyone's message and incorporate them into the
      discussion. I want everyone to feel like they can belong. This has the
      effect of sparking a desire to continue conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other streamers do this by creating provocative content. Content that
      sparks a reaction and is controversial tends to work quite well.
      Ironically, you don't have to be agreeable, just provocative. Your
      viewpoints can either agree with the viewers strongly or disagree with the
      viewers strongly. Both will attract them, as long as it is engaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Mux fans will remember the day I got scammed on stream, which caused a
      huge peak in chatters.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/twitch-essentially-tinder-6.png" />
    <p>
      Was it really so bad though? After all, I got 50 new views that I wouldn't
      have gotten otherwise. Turns out, Twitch's algorithm rewards active
      chatting, so whatever gets people chatting will typically result in a
      boost in organic traffic.

        >Noone knows what it means, but it's provocative. It gets the people
        going.</a
      >
      <strong>Spark that reaction.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Tip 3. Choose photos that are easy to understand.</h2>
    <p>
      In the <a href="/variety-streamers-on-twitch.html">first edition</a>, I
      covered how category hopping can benefit your stream by giving additional
      exposure. In the context of approaching content creation like dating, this
      elucidates the reason more clearly: in a pool of look-a-likes, any sort of
      diversity is interesting.
    </p>
    <p>Take a look at the tag <strong>Permadeath</strong>.</p>
    <img src="/images/twitch-essentially-tinder-4.png" />
    <p>
      The top "above the fold" content is all gaming: 3D generated worlds. No
      surprise there, these are all hardcore games that match the tag
      <strong>Permadeath</strong> quite well. But if you're an IRL streamer, try
      tagging your stream with <strong>Permadeath</strong>. Suddenly, your
      stream stands out from the crowd. Among the sea of video game streams,
      you're the only one with a <em>real video</em>. Perhaps most funnily, your
      stream is the only one that is true <strong>Permadeath</strong>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Tinder is packed with people wearing beige, brown, navy, and black, so a
      bright pop of color, like a red shirt, will catch someone’s eye
      immediately.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Being different isn't a negative, it's a huge positive. In my personal
      dating life, this is the hardest obstacle to overcome. I have talked on
      stream about how people have assumptions about me before hearing me talk
      and this is very true on dating apps: it's no surprise that an Asian male
      looks rather generic since it's
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_world#Shares_of_world_population,_0%E2%80%931998_A.D._(%_of_world_total)"
        >among the largest share of the global population</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      To combat that effect, I need to stand out. My first impression should
      <strong>play my strengths</strong> and
      <strong>divert away from my weaknesses</strong>. It's no accident that I
      am not visible for most of my stream. I want your first impression of me
      to be what I have to say and the beautiful city that I live in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose your content in a way that makes you
      <strong>stand out among the crowd.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Tip 4. Say what you’re looking for in your profile.</h2>
    <p>
      I see a lot of streamers get caught up in moderation, trying to police the
      content on their channel. Meanwhile, I have the complete opposite:
      essentially no moderation, no rules, and no guidelines. Occasionally I
      need to intervene, but for the most part it works quite well.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      No need to burn yourself out by having to manually filter through all the
      potential partners who aren’t aligned with what you want. Let them do it
      themselves!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I believe that this is because I choose discussions that encourage good
      behavior. I've built a community of people who want to see the content
      play out, so they police themselves. Pay attention to how your viewers
      talk about the content you're putting in front of them and try to align
      what they talk about with how you want your relationships to evolve. The
      key idea is that by nudging instead of actively policing, it's much more
      efficient than weeding through misbehaving viewers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my ~300 hours of streaming, turns out my one mod has only ever had to
      ban one user. Not too bad!
    </p>
    <img src="/images/twitch-essentially-tinder-5.png" />
    <p>
      This approach will vary from streamer to streamer. Of course, I realize my
      channel is a bit of an outlier. Your choice of content may elicit
      different behavior from people and you may not want to deal with that. But
      remember that at this stage, every ban is essentially a permanently lost
      viewer. Perhaps someone, once seeing your potential, wants to behave
      differently. Maybe they made a mistake or maybe their first impression was
      misinterpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      People can change and I believe in giving viewers a second chance to be a
      part of the channel.
      <strong>Say what you're looking for</strong> on your stream and your
      audience will follow without lifting a finger.
    </p>
    <h2>Tip 5. Take advantage of busy Tinder times.</h2>
    <p>
      This one is
      <a href="/lessons-from-broadcast-television.html">dayparting</a>.
      <strong>Take advantage of the best times to stream.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Tip 6. Be open to meeting more than just an S.O.</h2>
    <p>
      Keep an open mind about what kind of content you're willing to stream. For
      example, am I really a bike streamer?
    </p>
    <img src="/images/twitch-essentially-tinder-3.png" />
    <p>
      Based on my thumbnails, you might not think so. This is intentional. Don't
      stick to one type of content too much if you're not traction, explore
      different content ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notably, you might think this is at odds with my claim that content
      doesn't matter. I assert that the best way to grow is for you to believe
      the content doesn't matter. That is, don't get tied down to any single
      type of content, let your viewers guide you. Don't stick with a single
      game if it isn't working. Play different games and be that variety
      streamer of your dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can, however, stick to a core principle around your content, much like
      how most of my streams involve a bicycle.
      <strong>Be open to different kinds of viewers</strong> who are interested
      in different kinds of content. Attract a diverse audience and remember the
      same theme as the previous two posts: exposure at all costs.
    </p>
    <h2>Essentially Tinder</h2>
    <p>
      I think it's no coincidence that these tips from Tinder can apply to
      Twitch. After all, my stream, if you squint, is just a very efficient way
      of getting to know me. I want my Twitch profile to represent me myself and
      let you get to know me as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      That, in my opinion, is the sticking point. You should be able to get the
      best impression of me possible within the first few minutes of watching.
      If you don't like me, you should be able to find out very quickly and
      churn off, and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it's no surprise that Twitch is similar to Tinder: both are games of
      efficiently building a relationship. This will grow your channel to the
      point of not being able to identify individual viewers, which I believe to
      be at around 5k concurrent viewers. After all, look at some of the biggest
      streamers. They tend to be very lovable and easy to get to know.
    </p>
    <p>That's not an accident, that's engineered.</p>
