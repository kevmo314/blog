    <h1>Faster Twitter Embeds</h1>
    <em>December 25th, 2022</em>
    <p>I saw another interesting tweet today:</p>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
      <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
        Blank page with an embedded tweet. How bad can it be?<br /><br />JS:
        1.5MB ðŸ¤¯<br />PageSpeed score: 61/100 ðŸ¤¯<br />Time to Interactive: 9 sec
        ðŸ¤¯<br />TBT: 1.7 sec ðŸ¤¯<br /><br />What hope does an average site have
        if a simple tweet requires MegaBytes of JS and seconds to
        interactivity?<a href="https://t.co/0CJBe6LXCP"

      It's true! Although maybe not as bad as the post seems to indicate. The
      initial load of a tweet is ~460kB of resources transferred resulting in
      ~1.4MB uncompressed. That's a lot of data for a single tweet. Can we do
      better?

    <p>
      Inspecting the Twitter embed code, we see that after the static HTML
      version of the tweet, a script is injected.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/faster-twitter-2.png" alt="Twitter embed script" />
    <p>
      This script is responsible for loading the rest of the tweet. There are a
      few approaches, mostly geared around statically rendering tweets, but I
      don't really like these. I want to embed tweets independently of what
      framework I'm using. I mean, this blog is using manually-written HTML
      hosted on GitHub pages. No plugin is going to help me there!

        I&#39;ve been saying this is a scenario where your framework doesn&#39;t
        matter. It&#39;s wild, but true. One of the best solutions I&#39;ve seen
        is done statically by
        <a href="https://twitter.com/Swizec?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@swizec</a> and

      What if we hijack this script and replace it with our own? As in, build
      the embed window from scratch. I'll embrace the iframe approach and
      instead just
      <em>do the same thing more efficiently</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an afternoon of work, I cut it down to ~56kB unpacked! That's a
      whopping <strong>95% reduction</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>Lighthouse is, of course, much happier.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>JS size down 95% from 1.5MB to 56kB</li>
      <li>PageSpeed score up from 61/100 to 92/100</li>
      <li>Time to Interactive down from 9 sec to 0.8 sec</li>
      <li>Total Blocking Time down from 1.7 sec to 0.2 sec</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="/images/faster-twitter-3.png" alt="Lighthouse score" />
    <p>
      To use the embed, find the <code>platform.twitter.com</code> domain in the
      embed's <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag and replace it with
      <code>platform.fastertwitter.com</code>. That's it!
    </p>

      >
      Yeah, that's pretty much what the iframe does. The slowness is not from
      the iframe, it's from Twitter's HTML/CSS bloat. You could replace the
      tweet directly too, but it's more code to maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given how big of an improvement there was here, this honestly makes me
      think it could be possible to rebuild Twitter's frontend, just a lot
      faster. I mean, their API is zippy, why isn't the frontend? If you're
      interested in this, I'd love to hear from you! The code is coming soon on
