    <h1>Time-Invariant Finite State Machines</h1>
    <em>December 13th, 2020</em>
    <p>
      A <a href="https://www.blogzhang.com/">friend</a> posited a question about
      my previous
      <a href="/finite-state-machines.html">finite state machines</a> post:
      <strong
        >how do we model scheduled state transitions in a finite state
        machine?</strong
      >
      For example, with the door finite state machine, the door might close
      automatically after
      <em>t</em> seconds. Similarly, the button finite state machine might
      timeout if the user holds the button down for too long.
    </p>
    <h2>Scheduling the transition</h2>
    <p>
      Let's take the door example as we saw earlier, except modify it to
      automatically transition from <strong>open</strong> to
      <strong>closed</strong> after two seconds if it hasn't been closed.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/time-invariant-finite-state-machines-1.png" />
    <p>
      The original solution, with no auto-closing, has been copied below for
      reference.
    </p>
    <pre>
type OpenState = "open";
type ClosedState = "closed";

type DoorState = OpenState | ClosedState;

function close(state: OpenState): ClosedState {
  return "closed";
}

function open(state: ClosedState): OpenState {
  return "open";
}</pre
    >
    <p>
      One approach to implementing an automatic door closing is to simply
      schedule a close action with <code>setTimeout()</code>. This works, but is
      both wildly unsatisfying and has some hidden complexity. Consider, for
      example, when the door is manually closed and then reopened. The existing
      timeout must be cancelled and rescheduled, otherwise the door may close
      prematurely. This might be implemented as such:
    </p>
    <pre>
let door: DoorState = "closed";

door = open(door);
let timeout = setTimeout(() => door = close(door), 2000);
door = close(door);
clearTimeout(timeout);
door = open(door);
timeout = setTimeout(() => door = close(door), 2000);</pre
    >
    <p>
      Perhaps some of that logic can be abstracted to common functions, but as I
      mentioned, <em>wildly unsatisfying</em>. There is a better solution, which
      the title of this post hints at: making the finite state machine
      time-invariant.
    </p>
    <h2>What is time, even?</h2>
    <p>
      To make the finite state machine time-invariant, we incorporate the
      <strong>time</strong> that the last event occurred into the state. Then,
      in order to determine if the door is open or not, instead of looking
      directly at the state, we compute the output state based on the door state
      and the time of the last event.
    </p>
    <p>
      If that's a bit confusing, don't worry. It's a bit simpler to understand
      with code. First, we adjust our <code>OpenState</code> to include the time
      that it was opened at. The <code>ClosedState</code> doesn't need to change
      because the door doesn't auto-open, but we adjust the signature a bit to
      keep things consistent.
    </p>
    <pre>
type OpenState = { type: "open", at: Date };
type ClosedState = { type: "closed" };</pre
    >
    <p>
      In these signatures, <code>type</code> is a
      <strong>string constant</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>Our <code>DoorState</code> remains unchanged</p>
    <pre>type DoorState = OpenState | ClosedState;</pre>
    <p>
      The transition for <code>close</code> doesn't change, but now
      <code>open</code> must include the date to correctly satisfy the type
      definition.
    </p>
    <pre>
function close(state: OpenState): ClosedState {
  return { type: "closed" };
}

function open(state: ClosedState): OpenState {
  return { type: "open", at: new Date() };
}</pre
    >
    <p>
      Now, in order to determine if the door is open or closed, we need a view
      function.
    </p>
    <pre>
function view(state: DoorState): "open" | "closed" {
  switch (state.type) {
    case "closed":
      return "closed";
    case "open":
      const now = new Date();
      if (now.getTime() - state.at.getTime() > 2 * 1000) {
        // The door has been opened for more then 2s, so it's really closed.
        return "closed";
      } else {
        return "open";
      }
  }
}</pre
    >
    <p>
      And now, we can properly open our door and expect that it transitions out
      of being opened after two seconds.
    </p>
    <pre>
let door: DoorState = { type: "closed" };

door = open(door);  // Open the door.

console.log(view(door));                          // Prints open.
setTimeout(() => console.log(view(door)), 2100);  // Prints closed, 2100 to avoid a race.</pre

    <h2>Lenses: a tinted view of the state</h2>
    <p>
      Perhaps you'd like to tell me now: Kevin, this is cheating! The state
      isn't actually transitioned!
    </p>
    <p>
      It's true that the underlying state isn't actually transitioned, but the
      key insight here is that the output of <code>view</code> is uniquely
      determined by the input state (<code>door</code>) and current time. In
      fact, all modelable systems will behave like this. Unless another
      transition occurs, any closed machine that follows like the one above can
      be
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system"
        >deterministically modeled</a
      >
      by its initial state and time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a pretty nice property, as it suggests that as long as we
      incorporate the time of the event into our state, we can project our state
      however we like. Even as the finite state machine gets more complex, as
      long as we do not introduce any non-determinism, the output state can
      <em>always</em> be calculated as a function of the last known state. In
      fact, because computer random number generators are often not truly
      random, we can even model "randomness" too, to a degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best reference to this approach of using a <code>view</code> function
      that I could find is the functional
      <a
        href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Lenses_and_functional_references"
        >lens</a
      >. The <code>view</code> function above only implements a getter, however
      it's also possible to implement a setter. I don't think it matches
      exactly, but I think the name works: the lens is a view of the state. In
      this case, the view that we actually want.
    </p>
    <h2>Extending beyond time</h2>
    <p>
      Considering the above approach more deeply, we can also extend further by
      lifting any details that might result in "scheduled transitions" into the
      current state. For example, if the door must automatically close and open
      repeatedly but manually opening or closing it resets the process, we can
      also model this by incorporating the time into the closed state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's an exercise I'll leave to the reader: suppose the door will
      auto-close after two seconds unless the door was opened within one second
      of the last close. How might we model this scenario without actually
      invoking the transition?
    </p>
