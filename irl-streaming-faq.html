    <h1>IRL Streaming: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <em>May 16th, 2021</em>
    <p>
      People often ask about
      <a href="/the-road-to-zero-disconnects.html">my setup</a> and ask how they
      can get started streaming with it. If you're new to streaming, here's a
      simple FAQ for the most common questions I see about how to start
      streaming.
    </p>
    <h2>How do I stream?</h2>
    <p>Step 1: Click the stream button in the Twitch app.</p>

    <p>Step 2: Click Stream IRL.</p>

    <p>Step 3: Stream.</p>

    <p>Tada, you're streaming!</p>
    <h2>How do I set up an RTMP server?</h2>
    <p>Don't bother, you don't need one.</p>
    <h2>How do I use SRT?</h2>
    <p>Doesn't matter. Just click stream.</p>
    <h2>Should I get a LiveU?</h2>
    <p>No.</p>
    <h2>How do I build my own LiveU?</h2>
    <p>Don't bother, use your phone.</p>
    <h2>How do I get 1080p 60fps?</h2>
    <p>Who the fuck cares.</p>
    <h2>How do I add overlays?</h2>
    <p>Dunno, figure it out later. Doesn't matter.</p>
    <h2>How do I stabilize the video?</h2>
    <p>Don't move your hand so much.</p>
    <h2>How many SIM cards do I need?</h2>
    <p>One: your phone's.</p>
    <h2>Which cell provider is the best?</h2>
    <p>All of them. Whichever you're paying for now is fine.</p>
    <h2>Won't I run out of data?</h2>
    <p>You probably haven't yet. Deal with that when you run out of data.</p>
    <h2>Do I have enough bandwidth?</h2>
    <p>Dunno, click that stream button and find out.</p>
    <h2>Why is this FAQ so unhelpful?</h2>
    <p>
      The biggest key to success is consistency. It's not content, it's not
      stream quality, it's not stability. Be consistent, observe
      <a href="/variety-streamers-on-twitch.html">the</a>
      <a href="/lessons-from-broadcast-television.html">patterns</a>, contribute
      to the community, and you will grow. Your viewers don't care if you have
      mediocre content, terrible quality, or unstable connections. They are
      there because they want to spend time with <strong>you</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I see a lot of new streamers get so caught up in their desire to have a
      perfect stream that they forget the whole goal in the first place: to
      stream. Put your content out there. It doesn't matter if it's bad, it
      doesn't matter if it's scuffed. Start with the lowest bar in the world and
      work up from there. Don't waste time and money finding solutions to a
      problem you don't even have. Many of the biggest IRL streamers use nothing
      but a cell phone and gimbal, but instead of wasting time crafting the
      perfect streaming platform, they're actually out there streaming and
      building their audience. That's why they're successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until a problem is staring at you right in the face and it needs to be
      solved because your viewers are complaining about it, don't bother. For
      what it's worth, I've never heard of anyone not watching a stream because
      there are no overlays.
    </p>
    <p>Unsurprisingly, this is true for a lot more than just streaming.</p>
