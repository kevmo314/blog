    <blockquote>Statistics is just formalized common sense.</blockquote>
    <p>
      I'm sure I have the exact quote wrong and I don't even remember the
      source, but the gist has stuck with me for a while. Statistics is
      fundamentally quite simple: it's common sense written down. Distributions
      are a way of representing what might happen and their likelihoods, and
      everything derived from that is just logical common sense.
    </p>
    <p>Simple.</p>
    <p>
      When working with statistics, however, it's easy to lose sight of the true
      goal. Much like a speedometer on a car, statistics can provide data and
      insight about our world, but it's important to know when to look at the
      speedometer and when to look at the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we decided to take a seed check from
      <a href="https://gsrventuresglobal.com/">GSR Ventures</a>, we chose them
      not because they were objectively the best deal, but because they
      <em>felt</em> like the right people to work with. We used information and
      historical data to ensure we reached a deal that we were happy with and
      everything beyond that was just intuition and trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd like to think that everything can be characterized with statistics,
      but the truth is that as we make decisions we take in way more information
      than we know how to formalize. Sometimes, decisions just need to be made
      based on intuition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why does this happen? Because ultimately, people aren't rational agents.
      Economics has found time and time again that our models can't effectively
      characterize all of human behavior. Even as we push the frontiers of
      behavioral economics, modeling subtle nuances in behavior with statistics,
      a grand theory of human behavior still eludes characterization. So as much
      as we'd love to model everything and make perfectly-informed decisions,
      ultimately how our choices affect outcomes will be driven by a lot of this
      uncharacterized behavior.
    </p>
    <p>Effectively unpredictable.</p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, I see people trying to optimize and inform decisions by
      collecting every possible data point they can. But collecting data isn't
      free. At some point, the marginal return of each data point diminishes far
      below the cost of the data itself. Engineers fall into this trap a lot,
      trying to fix bugs before they even happen. When was the last time you
      tried to optimize something that wasn't even a problem yet?
    </p>
    <p>
      I have to wonder why we ended up this way. I think the introduction of
      information has scared us a little. Unintuitively, knowing more about the
      world has made us more afraid of it. Certainly humans were not always this
      risk averse.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're reading this, you're probably in the top 1% of the world. Lucky
      enough to have a massive social safety net underneath us. The days of
      daily life and death are gone, replaced with fears of being "unsuccessful"
      which seems to somehow scare people more than the fear of being eaten by a
      lion. But how many people in that top 1% couldn't recover from failure?
      Probably fewer than those who were eaten by lions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take that leap of faith. Enjoy the ride. It'll be okay. Statistically
      speaking, of course.
