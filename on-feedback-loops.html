    <h1>On Feedback Loops</h1>
    <em>October 15th, 2020</em>
    <p>
      For early startups, growth is paramount to success. To drive growth,

      focusing on acquisition and engagement loops. For us at
      <a href="https://doahuddle.com/">Huddle</a>, this means we think a lot
      about how to create feedback loops to acquire and engage brands,
      consumers, and influencers. That's a lot of loops to nail down! And
      chasing positive feedback loops can be daunting: it's a vaguely-structured
      idea that's easy to tell when it exists but not so easy to create from
      scratch. Indeed, in Andrew's post, he covers many great examples of
      feedback loops, but actually creating them is left as an exercise for the
      reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our approach to reliably and repeatedly creating positive feedback loops
      involves looking at a more microeconomic level with
      <strong>individual incentive alignment.</strong> We find our strongest
      alignment not by direct incentives such as taxes and subsidies, but rather
      by applying

        >structural nudges</a

      to encourage the equilibria we want to reach.
    </p>
    <h2>1. Choose a motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Why did the user open our app? Users use a product for a whole slew of
      motivations. For Huddle, perhaps they're coming to shop or maybe they're
      seeking a new connection. Perhaps they received a notification and are
      reengaging. This motivation is the user's intent. To focus on growth, we
      choose a specific set of intents that we wish to encourage.
    </p>
    <p>For example,</p>
    <h2>2. Map out the journey with this motivation</h2>
    <p>
      What will the user do in order to fulfill their motivation? Can we make it
      easier with fewer steps?
    </p>
    <h2>3. Verify that the motivation is satisfied</h2>
    <p>
      Did the user actually find what they're looking for? At Google, I found
      the best way to verify that users were indeed satisfied was just watching
      them use the app. No conversations, no questions, just observing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching users makes it pretty clear when the UI isn't up to par. For
      example, Google flights will tell you when a flight is substantially
      delayed.

      When this feature first launched, it was buried behind a tooltip when you
      hovered over an icon. Turns out, very few users actually discovered this
      tooltip, which became obvious when looking at someone use the website.
      Verifying that motivations are satisfied guarantees that engaged users
      will guide the product development flow instead of guessing.
    </p>
    <h2>Why we think this matters</h2>
    <p>
      We differentiate our strategy by focusing on individual motivations
      instead of the actions we want to encourage. Instead of just considering
      "why might a viewer want to view content?", we ask "why might a viewer
      want to view content given that the content creator is seeking new
      friends?". For us, it's important to
      <strong>pin the initial motivation</strong> and build the product around
      that motivation and user journey instead of individual components of the
      feedback loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was at Google, our growth strategies consisted of focusing on
      <strong>critical user journeys.</strong> I see aligning incentives to be
      an iteration of that strategy, focusing on user-defined motivations
      instead of product-defined journeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incentives and emotions are core to human behavior. Arbitrary user
      journeys are not. Tying a user journey to addressing a core incentive,
      such as feeling the need for connection and socialization, grounds our
      user journey in a repeatable, exogenous trigger instead of a product-level
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Put simply, we change our mindset from "does this feature help users find
      the content they want?" to "does this features help users address the
      reason they came to the app?", which we believe both strengthens the
      feedback loop and simplifies the development. Huddle is still a young
      startup, so this approach has yet to be proven. But it's the lens we view
      everything through and drives our decision making all across the company,
      from product to hiring.
