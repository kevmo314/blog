    <h1>Yet Another Cofounder Retrospective</h1>
    <em>April 6th, 2022</em>
    <p>
      Everyone seems to write one of these, but I'd like to offer a unique
      thought I haven't seen elsewhere. For all three of you who read my blog
      regularly, you might've realized that I left my two cofounders at
      <a href="https://www.hoodle.xyz/">Hoodle</a>,
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielvykhopen">Dan</a> and
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackkuveke/">Jack</a>, to restart my
      own company, <a href="http://muxable.com/">Muxable</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll spare you the details in common with every other retrospective but a
      question that's stuck in my mind is <strong>when did I know?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I think this happens in all relationships. There's a tipping point after
      which I've given up. After which I don't believe the relationship will
      work. After which any effort to rebuild the relationship will be
      half-hearted because deep down I know it won't pan out. In many cases, a
      new, different relationship will come in, but the old one has passed the
      tipping point and generally can't be saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good cofounders never pass that point, otherwise inevitably the working
      relationship, well, doesn't work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>So when did I know?</strong> The strongest signal was when we
      discussed features and an argument against my proposal was that people
      aren't like me and therefore don't value the same featureset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Funnily, it's not the correctness of the argument that mattered. People
      are unique and maybe I am more unique than others. But I fundamentally
      believe that I should
      <a href="https://patzhong.com/solve-your-own-problem/"
        >solve my own problem</a
      >
      and like-minded people will follow. If I'm not solving my own problem, I'm
      competing against people who are solving the problem with more
      information, more experience, and ultimately more relevance. It's a losing
      battle and I can't do as good of a job as when I solve my own problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      So a statement like "people aren't like you" to me suggests that it's not
      the target customer that I'm different from, it's my cofounders.
    </p>
    <p>And that's when I knew it wouldn't work out.</p>
