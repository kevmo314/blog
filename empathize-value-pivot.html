    <h1>Empathize, Value, Pivot: Sales Tactics for Engineers</h1>
    <em>March 14th, 2023. Happy pi day!</em>
    <p>
      I periodically will interview for roles I'm not qualified for. Not like
      upwards in my career but for roles in completely different industries.
      It's fascinating to talk to people whose jobs are nothing like mine and
      learn how they think. Everyone is smart in their own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, one day I found myself in an interview for an "entry level account
      manager", aka cold calling sales rep, aka telemarketer. When cold calling,
      typically the biggest challenge is convincing someone who had no intention
      of buying something to open up their wallet on the spot.

        guys.</em
      >
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Much like Wolf of Wall Street, my interviewer said that people will give
      any reason under the sun to want to hang up, they're not in front of a
      computer, they can't make a decision, they don't have time, their fish
      needs to be walked, etc. But it turns out if he can get them to keep
      talking, most people <em>will not</em> hang up because few want to be seen
      as rude for hanging up while someone is talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he said that he follows a simple framework:
      <strong>Empathize, Value, Pivot</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      When he runs into an objection, he will first <em>empathize</em> with the
      problem. Remind them that their concerns are valid. Then, he will make a
      <em>value proposition</em> to the customer. Something that helps them
      address the underlying concern. Lastly, he will <em>pivot</em> the
      conversation away from the objection towards where he wants to take the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Put concretely, a call to sell ads to a local pizza shop might go
      something like this:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Pizza shop: Y'know, I just don't think we have the marketing budget this
        year. Especially with COVID, we haven't had the foot traffic to justify
        spending more money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sales rep: Yeah, we've seen the pandemic hit a lot of local businesses
        really hard, some lost over half of their customers.
        <strong>(empathize)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Sales rep: How many customers do you get a day right now?</p>
      <p>
        Pizza shop: Not sure, it's been pretty bad, maybe a hundred at most.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sales rep: What would it be worth to you if we could get you 10-25 more
        customers a day in the door? <strong>(value)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Pizza shop: Oh wow, that would be nice. It would get a lot of our
        business back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sales rep: Can you pop open your laptop real quick and we can see what
        we can do in the next five minutes?
        <strong>(pivot)</strong>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In this example, the sales rep first validates the prospect's concerns and
      by <strong>empathizing</strong>, quickly builds trust. Then, he makes a
      value proposition so the topic is no longer about buying ads but rather
      about how to get more customers in the door. The sales rep doesn't need to
      promise that they will get 10-25 more customers a day, but only needs to
      inquire about its value which is sufficient to get the prospect to read
      between the lines. Because it directly addresses the objection though, it
      drives <strong>value</strong> regardless of the product's features. The
      sales rep doesn't even mention the product until the very end, at which
      point they've <strong>pivoted</strong> the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>Here's an example of how this plays out on a mock call:</p>
    <iframe
      width="560"
      height="315"
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DdWrD9b-qjY"
      title="YouTube video player"
      frameborder="0"
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
      allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    <p>
      Notice that the sales rep even manages to <em>discover</em> a problem:
      that the prospect's internet speeds aren't fast enough to support 4K
      video. Then she empathizes, saying if it's slow internet, it would result
      in lag, and offers a way to check and validate the concern. Then, she
      directly addresses the value of the new internet package. The prospect now
      sees that she can address the problem she's running into. Finally, she
      pivots towards negotiating the price. At this point, the prospect is
      already bought in, so all that remains is to close the sale.
    </p>
    <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
    <p>
      I'll be the first in line to say that I think sales can be quite sleazy.
      The above framework can feel manipulative, especially since the sales rep
      is the largest benefactor in the exchange, and as an engineer I want
      customers to buy products on their own merits. But people don't buy a 1/4"
      drill, they buy a 1/4" hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think acknowledging the value of how sales is done is important because
      it means that we're solving real problems, not solutions looking for a
      problem. Another way to look at it: even in a self-serving environment
      where you have little compassion for the prospect, it's still important to
      empathize with them. Maybe that's too philosophical.
    </p>
    <p>
      More generally, a second lesson I learned from this interview is that it's
      important to listen first. The first step is to
      <strong>empathize</strong> which means listening very closely. I had
      always heard that the best sales people are the ones who can talk the
      least and with this framework it makes sense: the customer will tell you
      everything you need to make the sale. And maybe that's true beyond sales
      too. All you need to do is listen.

        is telling you her diagnosis. - Fleishman is in Trouble S1E1

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I've made this mistake more than once in my personal life, maybe you have
      too? It's so hard to take off the engineer's hat. If you happen to be
      reading this, you know who you are and all I can say is I'm sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, if you're curious, I did get the job offer but I ended up
      declining. My interviewer started off the call grumbling and even told me
      he didn't expect it to go well. After all, nothing on my resume says I'd
      be qualified at all to do sales. But he said by the end that he was
      thorougly impressed and that I could have a real career in sales. I'm not
      so sure about that, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to learn.
