    <h1>In Praise of Live</h1>
    <em>April 25th, 2021</em>
    <p>
      If you've known me at all, you probably know that I'm a big proponent of
      live, synchronous communication and experiences. Silicon Valley, however,
      disagrees. Even <a href="https://a16z.com/">Andreessen Horowitz</a>, the
      lead investor in the synchronous communication app
      <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a>, pushes
      asynchronous recordings of Clubhouse rooms. This sorely misses the point
      of live experiences and in my opinion, undermines the most valuable part
      of Clubhouse.

      I'm not the kind of person to go to a music festival. I don't like driving
      to a stadium, waiting forever, and paying for overpriced food only to get
      a brief glance at the performing artist. For all intents and purposes, I'm
      the kind of person who would much rather listen to a music video than my
      favorite artist live. And not to mention, why pay for music when I can get
      it for free on the internet?
    </p>
    <p>
      This weekend Porter Robinson held his
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3r1EhVF4KE"
        >Secret Sky Music Festival</a
      >. Watching this live changed my opinion about live concerts. I can't skip
      this song, I can't rewind, I can't jump to a specific timestamp. Now I
      understood why people choose to go to concerts. The content being
      inaccessible is a <em>feature</em>, not a bug.
    </p>
    <p>
      You had to be there to get it though. If you're reading this and
      considering watching the festival's rerun, don't bother. It's not the
      same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike concerts, however, making the festival free on YouTube means that
      the content is more accessible from a financial standpoint. Anyone can
      watch, anywhere in the world. No longer is the festival constrained to the
      privileged few who can pay for tickets, now the only expense is time. On
      Twitch those that watch replays of live streams are shamed as "VOD losers"
      or "VOD frogs". It's better to watch the stream live, not just to be able
      to interact, but because the fact that it's slow and in real time is a
      <em>feature</em>. Suddenly, it doesn't matter how much money you have to
      contribute, the only thing of value is time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making data available after the fact, like Clubhouse recordings,
      undermines the value that Clubhouse rooms have. It makes them
      transactional. The room isn't an experience anymore, it's just a source of
      information. But if your only goal is learning, there are much more
      efficient ways to convey information than listening to recordings. Not
      coincidentally, this is the chief argument made by Clubhouse bears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comparing other platforms, so many decide to gate access by money. They
      charge upfront like MasterClass, demand subscriptions like Coursera, or
      even charge for live Zoom experiences. All this does is bias access to
      those who have money. You're fighting against your biggest customer base.
      With a live stream, it's the complete opposite. In fact, if you have
      money, likely your opportunity cost is too high. It's no wonder that
      everyone on Silicon Valley Twitter believes that async is the future
      because they're the ones that are at a huge disadvantage when it comes to
      synchronous content. But there's a long, long tail of people with a lot of
      time and not much money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robinhood realized that empowering that long tail is wildly lucrative. I
      believe the same is true for content. Valuable content can be produced by
      people who can command viewers' time, not just those who have some
      financially-restricted knowledge. Charging upfront is an async, privileged
      way of thinking. To capture the value the rest of the world provides,
      <strong>think in terms of time, not money.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Andreessen Horowitz should disable recordings. My friends used to try to
      explain concerts to me. It always ended up with "you had to be there". But
      I never understood because it was so easy to just watch a music video. For
      those of you who clicked on the music festival link, maybe you felt like
      you missed something because there is no recording.
    </p>
    <p>Make "you had to be there" a feature, don't undermine it.</p>
