    <h1>The Entertainment Value Curve: An Incomplete Model</h1>
    <em>September 21st, 2020</em>
    <p>
      Ravi Mehta discusses in
      <a href="https://www.reforge.com/blog/entertainment-value-curve"
        >a recent post</a
      >
      why TikTok has seen growth but Quibi hasn't. He explains that Quibi is
      missing social connection in its app and concludes that Quibi can address
      this by making content more shareable and personal. As he summarizes,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Quibi has been thinking about itself as a film studio. The company needs
      to think about itself as a social network.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      While the assertion that Quibi needs to think about itself as a social
      network is a valid conclusion, the approach that Ravi takes in the article
      relies on a number of unsupported assumptions and statistical mistakes
      that result in an overly-narrow conclusion. Quibi can opt to find success
      through thinking about itself as a social network, but what it ultimately
      needs is a unique differentiator, not necessarily to become a social
      platform. If it chases social blindly following Ravi's advice, it's likely
      it would end up as a YouTube clone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's analyze where the reasoning breaks down and how we can form a more
      complete perspective.
    </p>
    <h2>Entertainment Value = Production Value + Social Value</h2>
    <p>The key focus of the post is this graph:</p>
    <img
      src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56f152a22fe131e76648aba3/1600230150065-OQTH59OJC0P7CRATM5PS/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNvT88LknE-K9M4pGNO0Iqd7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UbeDbaZv1s3QfpIA4TYnL5Qao8BosUKjCVjCf8TKewJIH3bqxw7fF48mhrq5Ulr0Hg/evc?format=750w"
    />
    <p>
      However, looking closer at it, there are a number of fundamental problems.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        It is not clear why social value is a dependent variable and why
        production value is an independent variable. In fact, I would almost
        propose the opposite: that production value is more likely a function of
        social value.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is not clear why the products must lie on the same equivalence curve,
        but failed products can leave this curve.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      First, let's look at which variable is actually independent vs dependent.
      When products choose their strategy, they do not choose production value
      and let social value "naturally" fall out. Indeed, the post even suggests
      the opposite: that product strategy should actively choose social value as
      a focus. So we can imagine that perhaps a better solution is to flip the
      axes:
    </p>
    <img src="/images/entertainment-value-1.png" />
    <p>
      But even this isn't correct, because non-user-generated content sites like
      Netflix can choose the quality of their content. Indeed, sites like
      <a href="https://watchnebula.com/">Nebula</a> provide a Netflix level of
      social value, but slightly lower (non-Hollywood) production value. While
      maybe the success of Nebula is an open question, its slightly lower
      production value would indicate that it's doomed to fail according to the
      model. This conflict also suggests #2, which is that there's no reason to
      believe that successful products lie on this curve at all.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/entertainment-value-2.png" />
    <h2>So what's the fundamental problem here?</h2>
    <p>
      The problem is in the assumption of dependence. Pinning successful
      products to a fixed entertainment value implies that production value and
      social value are tightly coupled, which leads to nebulous conclusions.
      Instead of causating them, let's correlate them with a third input:
      investment of value. This investment may be monetary investment, time
      investment, or otherwise, but is fundamentally any type of expenditure for
      the company to trade money or time value for social or production value.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Social Value = f(Social Investment) <br />
      Production Value = g(Production Investment) <br />
      Entertainment Value = Social Value + Production Value <br />
      => Entertainment Value = f(Social Investment) + g(Production Investment)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Now, social value and production value are functions of the amount we
      choose to invest into them. This is naturally intuitive. I can buy a high
      quality production independent of who I am, and I can invest and expand my
      social network independent of the content I create. Adding this layer of
      indirection is subtlely, but significantly different. Now, entertainment
      value is not fixed (addressing #2) and there is no direct relationship
      between social value and production value (addressing #1).
    </p>
    <p>
      The importance of this indirection step also surfaces in how the
      proposition is interpreted. The original post asserts that:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Quibi made the mistake of thinking that "short" was the feature that
      people want, whereas "shareable and social" is what people want.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      which was true under the previous model, but the new model makes no such
      designation. Instead, the new model suggests that entertainment value can
      be increased by investing in either social investment or production
      investment. The difference, and where the original conclusion appears, is
      that in Quibi's case,
      <strong>social investment yields a greater return</strong>, or put in
      economic terms, the marginal gains are likely higher for investment into
      social.
    </p>
    <h2>What's the impact on the conclusion?</h2>
    <p>
      When considering this approach, we can now look at the final conclusion.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      If I were in Quibi's shoes, a few questions come to mind for their present
      quandary:
      <ol>
        <li>How might we... make content more shareable?</li>
        <li>How might we... make the app feel more alive?</li>
        <li>How might we... make the audience part of the creative process?</li>
        <li>
          How might we... spark conversation between the audience and the A-list
          community of storytellers, actors, and artists Quibi has assembled?
        </li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Now, let's approach this from an investment return perspective. The above
      pieces of advice still align, but it's clear it's not the only solution.
      Namely
      <strong>How might we... create higher production value content?</strong>
      is now a completely valid strategy. And I think it could also work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stepping back, the reason this subtle distinction matters is a broader:
      Quibi's problem is not that it's not social enough. Quibi's problem is
      that it isn't far enough away from the other points on that graph. Looking
      at the initial graph, disregarding the actual fit, Quibi isn't located far
      below the curve in some death zone, Quibi is just too close to Netflix and
      Netflix completely dominates the high production value regime.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/entertainment-value-3.png" />
    <p>Ravi's post even hints at this conclusion.</p>
    <blockquote>
      Quibi's design is most similar to Netflix. But Netflix isn't trying to be
      and doesn't need to be "snackable". Nobody wants Netflix with shorter
      episodes.
    </blockquote>
    <p>But this is lost in the original thesis.</p>
    <blockquote>
      The company faces a choice. Become more like Netflix or learn from TikTok.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      With the expanded model, we assert that becoming more like Netflix is also
      a death sentence. The company stands to gain much by learning from TikTok,
      in other words its largest marginal entertainment value gain is through
      social investment, but ultimately what is important is
      <strong>that it offers a unique value proposition</strong>
      along the entertainment value curve. And this isn't too surprising. What
      the model shows is that Quibi is too close to existing incumbents in the
      social value/production value space, so it doesn't provide a unique enough
      value proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what Quibi needs is to innovate, find a unique differentiator, and
      <strong>distance itself from Netflix</strong>
      beyond making videos shorter. It can learn from TikTok, but that's not the
      reason it might fail. In other words, Quibi needs to go this way:
    </p>
    <img src="/images/entertainment-value-4.png" />
    <!-- <h2>Linearity</h2>
    <p>
      I think even the above argument has a few unsavory assumptions. I mentioned with #3 that the original
      <strong>entertainment value = social value + production value</strong> equation, it implies a linear correlation.
      Conveniently, when approaching it from the investment standpoint this is no longer the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering <strong>Entertainment Value = f(Social Investment) + g(Production Investment)</strong>, if the functions
      <em>f</em> and <em>g</em> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb%E2%80%93Douglas_production_function">Cobb-Douglas utility functions</a>,
      then turns out Entertainment Value is also Cobb-Douglas and moreover, can be interpreted as a proxy for consumer utility.
    </p>
    <p>
      And turns out Cobb-Douglas both looks like the proposed shape and makes no assumption about a single curve, instead
      it represents a family of curves.
    </p>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Cobbdouglas.jpg" />
    <p>
      So this approach is both more intuitive and represents the relationship in the original data better. As a final whammy,
      Cobb-Douglas utility functions also correctly model decreasing marginal returns.
    </p>

      Thanks, economics.
