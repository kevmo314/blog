    <h1>Setting up Workload Identity Federation for GitHub Actions</h1>
    <em>December 26th, 2022</em>
    <p>
      If you use the
      <a href="https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth"
        ><code>google-github-actions/auth</code> GitHub action</a
      >, it now recommends you authenticate via
      <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation"
        >Workload Identity Federation</a
      >. Buzzwords aside, this is a way to authenticate to Google Cloud Platform
      by trusting that GitHub is GitHub, therefore they can be granted a service
      account instead of needing a separate JSON key to authenticate the
      connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are
      <a href="https://www.padok.fr/en/blog/github-action-gcp-identity">some</a>
      <a
        href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/enabling-keyless-authentication-from-github-actions"
        >guides</a
      >
      <a
        href="https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#setting-up-workload-identity-federation"
        >around</a
      >
      to set this up but I think it's easier to do it from the cloud console and
      we can explain what's going on instead of blindly copy/pasting
      <code>gcloud</code> commands everywhere.
    </p>
    <h2>Creating a new workload provider.</h2>
    <p>
      Head over to
      <a
        href="https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/workload-identity-pools"
        >Google Cloud</a
      >
      and create a new workload provider. Name your identity pool
      <strong>GitHub</strong> or whatever you'd like. This is meant to represent
      a given provider.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/workload-identity-federation-1.png" />
    <p>
      Next, create a new provider with the name <strong>GitHub</strong>, or also
      whatever you'd like, using OIDC and issuer URL
      <code>https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com/</code>.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/workload-identity-federation-2.png" />
    <p>
      Lastly, configure the following provider attributes. These map GitHub's
      information to Google Cloud, allowing Google Cloud to know who the token
      is for. The GitHub attributes can be found in
      <a
        href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#understanding-the-oidc-token"
        >OIDC documentation</a
      >. I'm not sure where the Google Cloud documentation can be found or if
      the latter three attributes are even necessary. I know they're used if you
      want to further restrict the scope of the pool, but I'm not sure
      otherwise. If you know, please let me know too!
    </p>
    <img src="/images/workload-identity-federation-3.png" />
    <p>
      This step is functionally identical to the <code>gcloud</code> commands
      documented
      <a
        href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/enabling-keyless-authentication-from-github-actions"
        >by Google</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2>Binding a Service Account</h2>
    <p>
      Now that we've created a workload pool and provider, we need to bind a
      service account to the provider. This is the service account that will be
      used to authenticate to Google Cloud Platform. Click
      <strong>Grant Access</strong> on the console.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/workload-identity-federation-4.png" />
    <p>
      Select the service account you'd like to use for your GitHub Action or
      create a new one.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/workload-identity-federation-5.png" />
    <p>
      Next, select the provider you created earlier, and for OIDC ID token path,
      put anything: it doesn't matter.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/workload-identity-federation-6.png" />
    <p>Download the file and it should look something like this</p>
    <pre>
{
  "type": "external_account",
  "audience": "//iam.googleapis.com/projects/********/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github/providers/github",
  "subject_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt",
  "token_url": "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/token",
  "service_account_impersonation_url": "https://iamcredentials.googleapis.com/v1/projects/-/serviceAccounts/github-action-******@********.iam.gserviceaccount.com:generateAccessToken",
  "credential_source": {
    "file": "asdfasdf",
    "format": {
      "type": "text"
    }
  }
}</pre
    >
    <h2>Setting up GitHub Actions</h2>
    <p>
      For the last step, set up GitHub Actions to Identity Federation. In your
      <code>google-github-actions/auth</code> action, copy the
      <code>workload_identity_provider</code> and
      <code>service_account</code> from the JSON file's
      <code>audience</code> and
      <code>service_account_impersonation_url</code> respectively. Note that
      they have slightly different formats, so trim as necessary.
    </p>
    <pre>
    - id: 'auth'
      name: 'Authenticate to Google Cloud'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v1'
      with:
        workload_identity_provider: 'projects/********/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github/providers/github'
        service_account: 'github-action-******@********.iam.gserviceaccount.com'</pre
    >
    <p>
      And you're done! Your GitHub action should now authenticate correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going back to the
      <a
        href="https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#setting-up-workload-identity-federation"
        >gcloud-based instructions</a
      >, now the assorted commands should make more sense. Maybe I'm just a
      visual learner.
